**Abstract:** Autism has long been considered a male dominated condition. However, more recent research suggests that the gap between males and females with autism is much smaller than previously thought. This research aimed to investigate how individuals who are female or presented as female when diagnosed feel about the diagnostic process pre, during and post diagnosis in the UK. Five participants took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences and opinions of the diagnostic process. A thematic analysis was conducted and the themes of Importance of Knowledge, Lack of Support After Diagnosis, Financial Cost vs Time, Relationship with other Conditions and Age and Autism were noted, with the Importance of Knowledge being split into two subthemes, self-knowledge and the knowledge of others. This research aimed to gain the opinion of individuals directly affected by the process of autism diagnosis by including them as much as possible in the research. It was found that participants believed that it is not exclusively females who struggle to gain a diagnosis but anyone out with the stereotyped autism phenotype. Future research should focus on gaining information from autistic individuals who are unable or uncomfortable communicating verbally. Furthermore, the information found in this research and others surrounding this needs to be implemented in provisions for autistic individuals. These provisions should reflect the diversities seen within the autistic community.

**Abstract:** **Introduction:** Understanding the factors affecting the ability to detect lies is particularly important in settings such as law enforcement. However, the majority of lie detection research has used low-stake (non-serious) rather than high-stake (serious) lies. Recent research indicates that high-stake settings may produce reliable cues indicative of deception that differ from those displayed in low-stake settings. <br>**Methods:** Shaw and Lyons' (2017) high-stake study investigated the effects of age, deception cue knowledge and confidence on lie detection accuracy. To validate their findings, the current study replicated their design. Participants were sorted into a cue (given deception cues) or no cue (used instinct) condition, viewed 24 video-clips of individuals making appeals for missing or murdered people, and then determined whether the individual was lying or not, how confident they were of their decision and whether they recognised the case. Participants also reported cues they used when detecting deception. Adding to Shaw and Lyons' (2017) design the current study controlled for sex of both participants and people in video-clips. <br>**Results:** In line with Shaw and Lyons' (2017) results, age was positively associated with lie detection accuracy and trivial effects were found for deception cue knowledge and confidence ratings. The effect of participants' sex on lie detection accuracy was trivial, however participants detected liars of the same sex better than the opposite sex. Participants who used head-movement and spoken-account cues were worse at detecting deception. In contrast, Shaw and Lyons (2017) found that participants were better at detecting deception when using emotion-based cues. <br>**Discussion:** The study provides further support and insight into the factors influencing lie detection. The limitations of these findings, and potential implications for future research, are discussed with reference to relevant literature.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** The visual system constantly optimizes itself, creating predictions and internal models to understand, navigate, and survive the natural world even in the face of incomplete or missing information. The creation of internal models in the primary visual cortex though feedback connectivity has been well documented in recent years in light of a predictive processing framework. However, how these internal models are stored in long term memory is not so well understood. Here we use a novel behavioral line drawing paradigm to test how internal models are stored in memory. In our main experiment we presented 183 individuals with occluded stimuli and minutes later tested whether they could identify the stimuli that was previously occluded. Thus, we did not test individuals' memory for images they had seen before but ones they had in fact never seen before - only merely predicted. We compared memory recollection between real images and line drawing internal model representations. Our findings show that participants can recognize real images in which they had never seen prior. Further we find that internal model memory is driven categorically or heuristically rather than feature specifically. We also may have evidence that the process of line drawing acts as an encoding mechanism for amodal completion.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Previous research reports anxiety to be higher in those with lower group identification and higher levels of autistic traits. However, to date, no study has investigated all three variables in the student population. It was hypothesised that (H1) group identification would be negatively correlated to anxiety, and autistic traits would be positively correlated to anxiety. Additionally, it was hypothesised that (H2) group identification and autistic traits would significantly predict anxiety. 169 students (137 female; 27 male; 5 non-binary) aged 17 to 52 years answered three online self-report questionnaires. H1 was accepted, with a strong negative correlation reported between group identification and generalised anxiety, along with a moderate-to-strong positive correlation between autistic traits and generalised anxiety, providing supporting evidence in line with previous findings. H2 was partially accepted, as group identification significantly predicted anxiety, but autistic traits did not. Regression results support research indicating group identification is predictive of better mental health, but also contrast previous research which suggested higher autistic trait scores predict negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety. Finally, the hierarchical regression results suggest a full or partial mediation effect of GIS on AQ-10 scores in predicting anxiety, therefore future research is needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Electrical brain oscillations reflect fluctuations in neural excitability. More than 90 years ago, fluctuations in the occipito-parietal alpha-frequency band ($\alpha$, 8-12 Hz) have been hypothesized to act as a sensory cortex gateway to perception. Several past and recent studies have addressed this hypothesis by linking $\alpha$ oscillations to perception. However, despite this hypothesis' long history and recent popularity, empirical evidence for it is still controversial and inconclusive. A common finding, is that the instantaneous phase of occipito-parietal $\alpha$ oscillations at visual stimulus onset, as recorded by extra-cranial electroencephalography (EEG), is correlated with the behavioral responses to that stimulus, such as required during visual detection tasks. This phase relationship with performance in visual tasks is usually interpreted in terms of an impact on perception. Yet, it is classically investigated in tasks requiring participants to produce a manual response upon visual stimulation. Accordingly, any $\alpha$ oscillation - response relationship may also reflect a pre-stimulus $\alpha$ phase influence on motor rather than visual processes, yet this has been largely ignored.  Considering this gap in the literature, I aimed to tease apart the relationship between the pre-stimulus occipito-parietal $\alpha$ phase and visual/perceptual processing versus motor preparation. To this end, I recorded EEG in 4 participants performing a computerised behavioural task across three conditions. I predicted a significant phase opposition in the pre-stimulus occipito-parietal $\alpha$ phase, relative to the timing in which a voluntary motor act occurs, and/or the amplitude of a visual EEG response (the C1-component). I did not expect significant phase opposition relative to the Reaction Time (RT) to a visual stimulus, based on the inconsistency in existing literature. Yet, results did not provide strong evidence of phase opposition in any condition.  Given the pilot nature of this study and the small sample size, results are not conclusive as to dis-proofing an effect and to challenge the $\alpha$ phase-behaviour relationship meaningfully. I discuss individual patterns of the findings and make recommendations for future investigations of phase opposition in the sensorimotor cortex and/or in the theta ($\theta$, 4-8Hz) band.

**Abstract:** Although social-communication difficulties and differences are central to the clinical characterisation of autism, most autistic people desire romantic relationships. Previous studies indicate autistic people use internet dating, but no research has explored dating apps. All participants (n = 151) provided demographic information and completed a qualitative Dating App Survey. A subsample (n = 104) completed the Motivations for Dating App Use survey, the Autism Spectrum Quotient-10, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief instrument and the Autism Spectrum Quality of Life scale. Linear models showed no association between quality of life and dating app use, and most participants had no preference for their partner's neurotype. Minority status, safety issues, gamification of interactions and dating norms all negatively affected participants' dating app experiences. Online communication, meeting new people and clear boundaries were mentioned as benefits of dating apps. These findings suggest autistic people experience varied barriers and benefits to dating app use, and the implications are discussed.

**Abstract:** Discussion of gender measures in psychology research has increased in recent years, yet there remains a lack of consensus, and dichotomous male/female measures remain the most commonly used. This study examines the impact of a 'non-binary' option, an 'other' option and explicit trans inclusion (i.e. 'male (cis or trans)') on comfort, ease, and accuracy of answering the question "What is your gender?" for transgender and non-binary participants. Participants answered 8 versions of the question, and then rated them on a 7-point Likert scale for each of the three aspects of answering experience. The results showed that only the 'non-binary' option had a significant impact, with an improvement in comfort, ease, and accuracy of answering observed.  Presence of an 'other' option and explicit trans inclusion had no significant effect. This suggests that addition of a 'non-binary' option to gender questions goes some way to alleviating the ethical issues associated with exclusive gender measures, without creating complicating data coding.

**Abstract:** Speech is a fundamental feature of human communication. This is widely studied across numerous fields including Social Psychology, where previous research has provided substantial evidence of speakers altering their speech in order to resemble that of their interlocutor. The present study intended to explore whether synchronisation of cognitive processing and rhythm alignment occurs across speaking turns in a standard conversation as existing literature is limited by the use of musical stimuli in studies. This was assessed using spoken responses from a sample of 64 native English speakers who were presented with a series of auditory maths sums. It was hypothesised that speakers would respond more consistently on beat to an isochronous stimulus than they would to a beat that is jittered. Although, results revealed that this was not the case. Aligned with previous literature, additional analysis identified that entrainment could occur in an alternative way where listeners in fact produce faster speech in response to hearing a faster tempo. Outcomes of this research suggest the need for future study in order to investigate the role of temporal accommodation in conversations within more natural contexts.

**Abstract:** **Background: **Social interaction during adolescence is increasingly occurring online, due to technology development and the recent COVID-19 restrictions (Office for National Statistics, 2020; Ofcom, 2020). While some research has explored how this has affected neurotypical adolescents (Orben & Przybylski, 2019), little has been done to understand how online interaction influences autistic youth. Current research is divided as to whether social media provides an 'optimal' method for autistic communication (Benford & Standen, 2009; Mazurek, 2013). Therefore, this study aimed to understand how online interaction influences autistic youth's quality-of-life.<br>
**Methods: **Non-autistic (N = 39) and autistic (N = 17) youth (ages 16-24) completed the Friendship Questionnaire (Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2003), the World Health Organisation Quality-of-Life-BREF scale (The WHOQOL Group, 1998) and reported their social media use. Autistic participants also completed the Autistic Spectrum Quality-of-Life domain (McConachie et al., 2018).<br>
**Results: **For both non-autistic and autistic participants, friendship scores and time spent on social media did not significantly predict quality-of-life. There was also no relationship between social media time and Autistic Spectrum Quality-of-Life scores. Qualitative analysis revealed the importance of autistic friendships, the influence of trust on communication preferences, the reduced reliance of masking behaviours online and the heterogeneity of communication preferences.<br>
**Conclusions: **Participants revealed that social media provided a valuable, but not optimal, medium for social interaction. The lack of relationship between social media and quality-of-life for both groups suggest the relationship is complex and requires further study. Qualitative results reveal that online communication has some benefits over face-to-face communication, however, many participants preferred to communicate face-to-face with close friends. This suggests a benefit of online communication may be that it provides an escape from masking exhaustion, but face-to-face is preferred when participants do not feel pressured to mask.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** A new concept known as the Light Triad (faith in humanity, humanism, and Kantianism) has had little empirical research and requires further investigation. As the Light Triad is a conceptual contrast to the Dark Triad (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy), research is needed to study Dark and Light Triad traits in concert to provide meaningful comparisons between perceptual and behavioural differences. A plethora of research surrounding the Dark Triad and deception portrays mixed results. No research exists investigating the Light Triad and deception. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to investigate the Light Triad and deception, in turn adding to the nomological network surrounding the Light Triad. A further goal was to add to existing research surrounding the Dark Triad and deception to combat mixed results. Self-report scores were collected online (n = 249) by the Short Dark Triad measuring Dark Triad traits, Light Triad Scale measuring Light Triad traits, Lying in Every Life and an amended version of Lying in a High-Stake Scenario scales measuring perceptions of low-stake and high-stake deception, respectively. Overall, the Dark Triad was positively related to both low-stake and high-stake deception, and the opposite was conveyed for the Light Triad. However, not all findings were consistent with existing research and unexpected results were found for Light Triad traits to both low-stake and high-stake deception. The results highlight the importance of future research to continue adding to the nomological network of the Light Triad and combat mixed results found for the Dark Triad and deception.
