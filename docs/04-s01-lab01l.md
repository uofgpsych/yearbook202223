**Abstract:** Almost 90% of applicants engage in some form of interview faking behaviour during selection interviews to increase hiring chances (Levashina & Campion, 2007). Impression management techniques are behaviours used by applicants to manipulate the interviewers' perception of them. Impression management behaviours introduce critical issues to employee selection processes as engagement of such behaviours can deprive a more qualified candidate of the job offer. In the present study, I aimed to discover the proximal antecedents of impression management that guide the association between personality and interview faking behaviour. A sample of 45 participants completed a series of questionnaires: namely, HEXACO Personality Inventory, Attitude questionnaire, Interview Faking Behaviour Scale short. In a mediation analysis, I examined the mediating effect of attitudes toward extensive image creation on the relationship between personality characteristics of Honesty-Humility, Extraversion and Conscientiousness and interview faking behaviour. The results were biased due to several limitations such as small sample size and too homogeneous data, therefore the data were uninformative with regards to the hypotheses. Nevertheless, the current study provides extensive information of the limitations in impression management research, which future studies can utilise when designing similar studies.

**Abstract:** **Objectives: **Social camouflaging is a concept first identified by the autistic community. It refers to specific behavioural patterns and strategies used by some autistic people to suppress or disguise autistic features. There is reason to believe however, that such behavioural patterns and strategies may also be present within those experiencing chronic pain.<br>**Design: **Social stigma, mental health difficulties and condition acceptance are some of the parallels between autism and chronic pain which may prompt individuals with chronic pain to adopt coping strategies resembling autistic camouflaging. Therefore, it is hypothesised that pain disability significantly predicts camouflaging scores, while pain acceptance potentially mediates the relationship between the two. <br>**Methods: **In this study, participants with chronic pain experience completed online questionnaires assessing their pain disability, their pain acceptance and their camouflaging scores using a newly devised camouflaging measure.<br>**Results: **Mediation analyses showed no mediatory role of pain acceptance. However, post-hoc regression analyses revealed that both pain acceptance and pain disability are significant positive predictors of camouflaging.<br>**Conclusions: **Although camouflaging may be motivated by negative concepts such as stigma, delegitimization and frustration, its effects may facilitate activity engagement a key feature of pain acceptance. Future research should aim in quantitatively investigating the motivators in conjunction with potential pain acceptance attitudes.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** **Introduction: **This research was conducted to investigate whether an individual's dark triad score predicts their tendency and motivations for lying.<br> **Methods: **Participants were 171 members of the general public. The Lying in Everyday Situations Scale (Hart et al., 2019) and the Short Dark Triad (Paulhus & Jones, 2011; Jones & Paulhus, 2013, 2014) were used. Vignettes were designed to investigate other-motivated lying and self-motivated lying.<br>**Results: **Multiple regression analysis showed both psychopathy ($\beta$ = .26, p = .01) and Machiavellianism ($\beta$ = .56, p < .001) to be significantly associated with an increase in Lying in Everyday Situations score. Narcissism had a negative association; however, this finding was insignificant ($\beta$ = -0.12, p = .30). Psychopathy score and Machiavellianism score are associated with an increase in the tendency to lie in everyday situations. Two separate linear regression analyses show that the Short Dark Triad score significantly predicts both other-motivated lying scores (F(1, 169) = 20.18, p < .05, R2 = .10, R^2^ Adjusted = .09) and self-motivated lying scores (F(1, 169) = 22.53, p < .05, R^2^ = .12, R^2^ Adjusted = .11).<br> **Discussion: **Possible reasons for the present results are discussed alongside other factors that may impact the variance of the models.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** The progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) differs between men and women. Despite this evidence of sex effects in AD functional biomarkers and the current diagnostic criteria for AD at a preclinical level has not taken sex into consideration. Inspecting this, by EGG methods, this study used a subject sample consisting of 62 patients (30 females, 32 males) and 69 healthy elderly as controls (36 females, 33 males). To analyse, a factorial ANOVA will be performed against Group, Sex, and Memory. The main findings of the analysis indicate significant sex results in the P300 and N400 amplitudes, and further analysis of the P300 showed an interaction effect of P300 amplitude where differences were seen between patient males and females but not in the controls. This indicates that there are sex effects measured by EGG that can be applied to the clinical management of AD. As a consequence, this paper adds to the growing body of evidence that men and women should be treated differently when being diagnosed with AD.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** The voice is one of the most socially salient aspects of human interaction and communication, containing many cues about an individual's personality, such as trustworthiness, dominance and attractiveness. Vocal attractiveness can, much like physical attractiveness, have a large influence on one's experience of the social world. Yet, there remains little investigation on the role of the listener in these experiences, often assuming a passive role. This study sought to examine whether listener personality - as measured by the Big Five model - has an impact on listeners' perceptions of vocal attractiveness of novel voices. Thus, 120 participants completed a personality measure and rated a selection of male and female voices. Results revealed that listeners' emotional stability was the only trait that correlated with average attractiveness ratings, though the observed effect was rendered statistically insignificant following correctional analyses. The nuances of personal standards of attractiveness and how they relate to personality differences are discussed, and potential future research directions are briefly considered.
