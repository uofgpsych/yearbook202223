**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Depression impacts an individual's mood, cognition and motor ability greatly affecting both the individual and society. Psychomotor retardation, impaired cognition and motor ability, as a symptom of depression may affect vocal production. This paper aimed to investigate whether there was a significant association between depressive symptoms and multiple vocal acoustics in a non-clinical sample. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to establish whether depressive symptoms could be predicted by voice. Participants (n = 24) were recruited via social media and the University of Glasgow's participant pool. Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale and recorded their voice reading the Rainbow Passage via remote participation. Multiple regression revealed support only for loudness being predictive of depressive symptoms. No support was found for other vocal acoustics being predictive of depressive symptoms. This study has implications on the theory of psychomotor symptoms in depression and their potential link to vocal production. In addition, this paper highlights potential task effects which have led to inconsistent findings as well as future implications of the present study.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** There is a distinct lack of research on fatigue expression in the general population, as well as in students. While models exist that attempt to explain fatigue in various populations, such as individuals with chronic conditions or mental health disorders (Corwin et al., 2002; Long et al., 2016), they have been found to poorly explain fatigue in the general population. The aim of this study is to examine fatigue in the general and student population during COVID-19. A fatigue battery of six different questionnaires (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Chalder Fatigue Scale and Fatigue Questionnaire, Toronto Hospital Alertness Test, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Barrow Neurological Institute Fatigue Scale) was used to evaluate the dimensionality of fatigue in the general population. While results from the principal component analysis (PCA) suggest a unidimensional concept, some evidence was found for a multidimensional approach when seven factors were forced. Furthermore, independent sample t-tests found a statistically significant difference in mental fatigue in the student population compared to the non-student population. However, no such difference was found in sustained fatigue, sleepiness, or physical fatigue. Implications of these results are discussed. A simultaneous qualitative study was conducted, consisting of interviews with students at universities in Glasgow and analysed through thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Results suggest that students struggled to adjust their fatigue reduction techniques to accommodate COVID-19 restrictions. Furthermore, students had to learn to navigate inadequate boundaries between work and personal life, handle the consequences of their new schedules, and cope with changes to their personal student identity. It is recommended that universities consider how students are coping with the global pandemic in order to effectively support them in completing university online.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Over the past two decades, a vast amount of research has demonstrated the influence of individual differences, such as age and gender, on consumer decision making. Likewise, cross-disciplinary research has demonstrated the impact of branding in biasing consumer decisions. However, to date, little research has examined the mediating role of individual differences in determining susceptibility to the brand bias. Therefore, an experiment was designed to investigate whether brand bias susceptibility differs significantly across age, gender and personality traits of the consumer. A series of binary choice tasks between two clothing items measured whether participants would choose a lesser quality branded product over a higher quality unbranded product and in doing so indicate a brand bias. The Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) were measured with the 60-item Big Five Inventory-2 questionnaire. The results found a significant correlation between age (range = 19 - 72 years) and brand bias; as age increased, brand bias decreased. From the personality traits, a significant negative relationship was found between Openness and brand bias, while the other four personality traits showed no significant correlation with brand bias. Lastly, analysing gender differences indicated that male participants were significantly more influenced by the brand bias than female participants. Taken together, these results suggest that brand bias susceptibility does differ across age, gender and personality traits. Further scientific research will be able to use these findings to build upon the knowledge of individual differences in consumer decision making, and brand marketers will be able to leverage this knowledge to optimise their marketing strategies.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Research  suggests  that  various  factors  of  student  employability  have  been  affected  by  the Covid-19 pandemic implying that student employability may be affected as well. Additionally, extensive  research  compares  different  employability  enhancing  approaches  between universities, however not within universities. The support students receive might influence how the pandemic affects their employability. Thus, the current study aimed to examine how the pandemic influenced students' perceived employability, comparing students' perceptions from different  Schools  within  a  Scottish  University,  who  have  access  to  different  employability support depending on School. 4 Business School and 4 Psychology students took part in semi-structured interviews where they discussed how the pandemic affected their employability and what support their Schools provides them. Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006)  was applied  to  the  data  following  transcription  of  the  audio-recorded  interviews.  The  analysis identified  6  overarching  themes,  Traditional  and  New  Skills,  Changing  Networking Opportunities,  Effects  of  No  Experience,  Difficulties  of  Online  Teaching,  Employability Support Provided, and Employability Support Needed. The analysis revealed differences and similarities  between  Psychology  and  Business  School  students  in  their  perceptions  of  the pandemic's impact on their employability and the support they receive. Implications of the findings are discussed along with the limitations of the study and the methodology applied.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Previous research has demonstrated that individuals exhibit an increase in trust as they grow older, referred to as the age-related trust bias. However, the underlying mechanisms by which this bias arises are relatively unclear. Thus, focusing on the age-related trust bias specifically within voice perception, the current study investigated the influence of age on underlying perceptual and cognitive processes which affect trustworthiness judgements of voices. 36 young listeners and 38 older listeners were presented with 30 male voice recordings saying the word 'hello'. All listeners rated each voice on perceived trustworthiness (i.e. the proxy of perceptual processes), and participated in a Dictator Game in which they indicated how much hypothetical money they would give to each voice (i.e. the proxy of cognitive processes). Spearman correlations showed that: 1) young and older listeners heard the voices as projecting similar levels of trust; 2) young and older listeners gave money to the voices in a similar manner; and 3) there was no difference between the relationship of age and trustworthiness ratings and the relationship of age and amount of money given. In short, our results suggest that the age-related trust bias within voice perception is not a result of differences in underlying perceptual or cognitive processing between young and older adults. Our findings are discussed in relation to existing theoretical concepts, and directions for future research are suggested.
