**Abstract:** **Background:** Historically, the motivations behind why individuals choose to engage in sexual intercourse have been considered simple and few. However, more recent literature has suggested that these motivations may in fact be greater in number and more psychologically complex. Past literature has indicated that demographic and personality factors may influence these motivations. The current study aims to investigate the motivations behind why individuals choose to engage in sexual intercourse, and the extent to which demographic factors and personality factors influence these motivations. <br>**Methods:** 469 participants (347 female and 122 male), completed a number of questionnaires investigating demographic information, religiosity, measured on the Self Report Religiosity Scale, personality, measured on the Big Five Inventory 2 (Short Version) and sexual motivations, measured on the YSEX?-SF scale. Four multiple regressions were calculated.<br>**Results:** Four significant regression models were found. Many demographic and personality factors were found to be significant predictors of a number of factors within the YSEX?-SF; physical motivations, goal attainment motivations, emotional motivations and insecurity motivations. Religiosity was found to be a significant predictor of physical, goal attainment and emotional motivations. Similarly, sexual experience was found to be a significant predictor of goal attainment, emotional and insecurity motivations. Several personality traits were found to be significant predictors of both physical and insecurity motivations. <br>**Discussion:** Many of the findings in the current study have been supported by existing literature in the area. A new finding surrounding the personality traits of low agreeableness and high openness as potential risk factors for experiencing sexual violence, was identified and discussed. Recommendations for further study include investigating the interaction between predictor variables and their influence on motivations behind why individuals may choose to engage in sexual intercourse.

**Abstract:** As a result of intersectional invisibility, Black women continue to be excluded, marginalised and overlooked within the UK higher education (HE) sector. Gaining positive visibility is imperative for Black women to be recognised as competent academics, change the prejudiced perspectives of those holding them back, and advance their careers within HE. Though existing literature provides a preliminary understanding of how Black female academics gain such visibility, the current study aims to extend knowledge in this area by exploring what strategies Black women of all academic levels use, and whether previous experience with gendered racism has any effect on the strategies utilised. Utilising an embedded mixed-methods design, this study explored the lived experiences of 47 Black female academics across the UK. Reflexive thematic analysis identified six themes: working twice as hard; being prepared; avoiding stereotypes; breaking down stereotypes; support and networking; and remaining invisible. Results of the Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale showed that previous experience with gendered racism does have some influence over the use of the 'avoiding stereotypes' and 'support and networking' strategies, with a multiple regression highlighting the roles of age and ethnicity within these relationships. The findings are discussed in terms of their impact on Black women's mental wellbeing, implications for current diversity management practices, and scope for future research.

**Abstract:** Dawydiak et al. (2020) found that pathogen disgust is positively associated with stigmatisation of mental health conditions. This study investigated the same concepts in relation to a wider range of mental health conditions. Furthermore, it determined whether the presence of a pathogen cue in mental health condition vignettes interacted with the relationship between pathogen disgust and stigma. An online survey measuring the three domains of disgust (sexual, moral, pathogen) and stigmatisation towards four mental health conditions was completed by 208 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to vignettes with or without pathogen cues for each mental health condition. Linear regression analysis was employed to explore relationships between three types of disgust sensitivity and presence of pathogen cue on stigmatisation of four mental health conditions. Pathogen disgust was a significant predictor of stigma towards anorexia, depression, schizophrenia and skin picking disorder, while sexual and moral disgust were not. Presence of a pathogen cue explained significant variance in relation to skin picking disorder. A 2x4 analysis of variance explored the interaction between stigmatisation towards the four mental health conditions, type of mental health condition and presence or absence of pathogen cue. There was a main effect of mental health condition with greater stigma towards schizophrenia than other conditions. There was no significant interaction between pathogen cue and type of mental health condition. The results align with research showing that overgeneralisation of disease avoidance may be relevant for understanding stigma towards mental health conditions.

**Abstract:** Literature has recognised that participating in team sport can have positive implications for an individual's sense of belonging and mental health. However there has been a gap in the literature on the topic regarding university students. This study focuses on male students. Two focus groups were conducted, each consisting of 7 participants who participated in team sport at university. Thematic Analysis was applied to collected data and four main themes emerged from the analysis: 1) Meeting New People and Building Relationships 2) Experience Sharing 3) Social Identity 4) Mental Health Implications. These data are discussed together with existing literature. Limitations, possible implications, and potential directions of future research are also discussed.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Well-being predicts important life outcomes such as positive mental health. Therefore, it is vital to understand both well-being and the factors that influence it. Social interaction is one of the strongest predictors of well-being. However, controversy remains over the importance of interaction quality and the role of technology-mediated interaction. Additionally, the field suffers from methodological shortcomings. Consequently, in this exploratory study, 34 participants took part in a 7-day experience sampling protocol, which examined the role of quality and method of interaction in predicting subjective well-being. To account for the nested data structure, linear mixed-effects models were used to analyse the data. Face-to-face interaction was the only method of interaction that predicted well-being. In addition, the role of interaction quality differed between methods of interaction. Moreover, in some cases, quality items were interdependent. Results demonstrate the need for longitudinal designs and support recent research by suggesting that although technology-mediated interaction is not comparable to face-to-face interaction, deterministic accounts of technology-mediated interaction may be exaggerated. Additionally, results indicate the need to study both relational and conversational interaction quality while distinguishing between different methods of interaction. Future confirmatory studies with large, diverse samples, and objective measures are needed to support and extend current findings.

**Abstract:** People make rapid personality attributions about others based on their facial features. Fundamental social trait dimensions (dominance, competence, trustworthiness, and warmth) underly these personality trait attributions. There is growing evidence to question the generalisability of these trait dimensions across male and female perceivers. Consequently, this study aimed to explore sex differences in social trait perception. Moreover, this study also explored sex differences in the use of facial cues during social perception. Thirty participants (15 female, mean age = 23.77 years) observed male and female faces and rated them on social trait dimensions. A general linear model revealed that female participant's show significantly increased perception of all the trait dimensions. We did not observe significant differences in male and female participant's cross trait correlations. Further results suggest that there are sex differences in the use of cues to perceive trustworthiness, warmth and competence trait dimensions. Our findings suggest that perceiver gender impacts social trait perception in both the behavioural perception of social traits dimensions and the facial cues used. We discuss our findings with references to gender norm endorsement and sex differences in sensitivity to valance and dominance cues.
