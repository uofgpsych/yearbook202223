<p><strong>Title: </strong> Stigma and attitudes towards seeking psychological help in student-athletes and their non-athlete peers</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Findings within the literature have been inconclusive regarding the differences in stigma and attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help between student-athletes and non-athlete students. Furthermore, although the type of sport (physical contact sport vs.Â physical non-contact sport) in which student-athletes compete might influence their levels of stigma, there is a lack of research further exploring its influence on their stigma levels and overall attitudes, and examining the differences in relation to these variables between student-athletes and their non-athlete peers while taking into account the type of sport. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the differences in public stigma, self-stigma and attitudes towards psychological help-seeking between student-athletes involved in physical contact sports, those involved in non-contact sports and non-athletes. Multiple One-way Between-subjects ANOVAs were conducted, with an ANOVA being performed per dependent variable (public stigma, self-stigma and attitudes). Contrary to what was hypothesised, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups of interest in public stigma, self-stigma and attitudes. These findings are interpreted and discussed in relation to previous research and several methodological limitations of the study, alongside with its potential implications and suggestions for further research.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Neuroanatomical Correlates of Psychosis Risk in Human Subcortex</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Psychosis is a ubiquitous and functionally disruptive symptom of many psychiatric disorders. Research has explored the neuroanatomical correlates in the human subcortex that may be a risk factor for developing psychosis. There are two hypotheses, these are the neurodevelopmental hypothesis which assumes psychosis is static and is acquired from brain defects during development that do not change after the onset of psychosis, and the neurodegenerative hypothesis assumes psychosis is progressive and that areas of the brain continue to alter after the onset of psychosis. However, the precise roles of these neuroanatomical correlates in the human subcortex during psychosis are unclear. Here we establish whether there is already a difference in subcortical neuroanatomical structures when comparing clinical high-risk patients with healthy controls. We found a significant finding for reduced hippocampal volume between first-episode psychosis (FEPâs) patients between healthy controls (CONS). No other significant findings for changes to any subcortical volumes were reported. Our results demonstrate support for the neurodegenerative hypothesis, as no differences in any of the subcortical structures were found before the onset of psychosis. We anticipate that these findings will strengthen the theoretical basis regarding the ongoing neurodevelopmental vs neurodegenerative debate and provide more robust evidence that reduced hippocampus volumes are a marker of illness and not a precursor. The implications of these results will help improve treatment recommendations and prognosis of any illnesses that involve psychosis.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Explaining Blame Attributions Towards Victims of Child Sexual Abuse: The Role of Gender, Personal Gender Attribution, Gender Role Beliefs, Just World Beliefs and Attitudes Towards Gay Men</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Relatively little is known about why victims of childhood sexual abuse may be blamed for their abuse, despite the wealth of research on attributions of blame toward adult victims of sexual assault. Yet, responses to disclosure of childhood sexual abuse are instrumental in the childâs subsequent processing strategies and so responses need to be supportive and free from blame to assist the child in reaching the best outcomes. This study examines the influence of Just World beliefs, gender, personal gender attribution, attitudes toward gay men, and gender role beliefs on judgements of victim culpability. Attitudes of the general population were assessed using a vignette which described the sexual assault of a gay, male, adolescent victim by a male perpetrator, followed by questionnaires. A generalised linear model was performed, and no support was found for an association between the predictor variables and victim blame. Overall, low levels of blame were found, with a significant tendency for participants not to attribute blame. However, a small number of participants indicated some degree of victim blame, demonstrating the need for continued research and attention. Explanations for the results are discussed alongside limitations of the study and theoretical and practical implications.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Virgil: âThe Greatest Wealth is Healthâ. A Quantitative investigation into the Preference for Online or Face-to-Face Counselling, with focus on participant age and the COVID 19 pandemic</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research indicates that mental health and well-being issues in the general population are on the rise during the pandemic, thus it is crucial that the public are then seeking treatment such as counselling. With this in mind, the current study aimed to explore preferences for a counselling method, whether this is online or face-to-face counselling, during the pandemic. The study also attempted to address how age and counselling seeking behaviour before the pandemic affects preference as this subject remains understudied. This topic was analysed through a multiple regression which revealed nonsignificant findings between counselling seeking behaviour before the pandemic, and age, on counselling preference during the pandemic. The findings have generated the potential for further research opportunities, and these are discussed along with deliberations regarding the studyâs methodology.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Investigating sensory features in trichotillomania: A quantitatively-driven embedded correlational concurrent mixed methods study using thematic</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> An emerging body of evidence suggests that trichotillomania may be maintained by differences in sensory processes. Utilising a quantitatively-driven embedded correlational concurrent mixed methods design, we investigated sensory features as a potential trigger for hairpulling. It was hypothesised that there would be a significantly positive association between hairpulling and sensory features. To assess our hypothesis, an opportunistically-recruited sample of adults (N = 48) completed the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HS) and the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ), with 41 participants opting to answer three open-ended questions about sensory features and trichotillomania. The GSQ as a measure of sensory features allowed for investigation of sensory features as a transdiagnostic construct characterising multiple conditions. A Spearmanâs correlation revealed no evidence that hairpulling, as measured by MGH-HS, and sensory features, as measured by GSQ, were significantly related (r<sub>s</sub>(46) = .15, p = .30, 95% CI [-.13, .40]). Thematic analysis of qualitative responses led to the development of four main themes: auditory sensitivity and self-soothing; tactile sensitivity and stimulation; need for control; and affective triggers. Integration of these findings drove five additional post-hoc correlational analyses between MGH-HS scores and GSQ scores in the auditory hypersensitivity (r<sub>s</sub>(46) = .26, p = .08, 95% CI [-.01, .49]), auditory hyposensitivity (r<sub>s</sub>(46) = .13, p = .36, 95% CI [-.15, .40]), tactile hypersensitivity (r<sub>s</sub>(46) = .08, p = .57, 95% CI [-.22, .38]), tactile hyposensitivity (r<sub>s</sub>(46) = .17, p = .26, 95% CI [-.14, .45]), and vestibular hypersensitivity (r<sub>s</sub>(46) = .22, p = .14, 95% CI [-.06, .49]) modalities. The current findings implicate a range of triggers in the maintenance of trichotillomania, particularly TTM-specific sensory features and emotional processes. Implications of these results for current theories of trichotillomania as well as its assessment and treatment were discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Developing and Assessing the Effectiveness of an Audio-Visual Immersive Therapy for Individuals Experiencing Anxiety</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The aim of this study assessed the effectiveness of an audio-visual immersion intervention for anxiety. We hypothesised participants would feel more relaxed after exposure to stimuli. A within-participant repeated measures design was used. Differences in STAIS-5 scores were analysed for each participant. Participants were recruited via the University of Glasgow participant pool, and via social media. Participants registered initial interest, then contacted to arrange participation. 41 participants were used (16 male, 24 female, 1 other), ages ranged 19-52 years. A significant difference was found between pre- and post-scores of anxiety, t(40) = 4.28, p &lt; 0.001. Gender differences had no significant effects. Qualitative themes for Thematic Analysis include reported relaxation and soothing effects, personal bias affecting the experience, and interaction and immersion experiences. A mixed methods contiguous approach was also used. Qualitative analysis indicated potential for personalisation, and to exist as a self-contained programme for widespread use and clinical applications. The study demonstrated the feasibility of remote delivery. Limitations to consider are individuals consuming anti-anxiety medications, potential cultural differences, and potential demand characteristics from participants.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Investigating the effectiveness of a female role model intervention for reducing Psychology students statistics anxiety levels</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Statistics anxiety is widespread, with more than 80% of graduate and undergraduate students experiencing it to some degree (Onwuegbuzie &amp; Wilson, 2003; Vahedi et al., 2012; Zeinder, 1991). Nevertheless, previous research has failed to study the impacts of the Gender Stereotype Threat on statistics anxiety (Cui et al., 2019). Previous research has only focused on the impact of using female role model interventions on mathematics performance (Marx et al., 2013; McIntyre et al., 2003). Thus, the current study investigated whether a female role model intervention could significantly reduce the statistics anxiety felt by female Psychology students in comparison to a male role model intervention. The current study had a sample size of n = 18, with participants split equally between the female role model intervention and male role model intervention. The Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS; Cruise et al., 1985) was used to assess participantsâ statistics anxiety pre-and post-intervention. An ANCOVA revealed a statistically non-significant difference in the female and male role model intervention groupâs post-intervention SA scores, F(1, 15) = 1.42, p = .251. The limitations, suggestions for future research and the implications of the study are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Experience of Diagnosis for Autistic Females</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Autism has long been considered a male dominated condition. However, more recent research suggests that the gap between males and females with autism is much smaller than previously thought. This research aimed to investigate how individuals who are female or presented as female when diagnosed feel about the diagnostic process pre, during and post diagnosis in the UK. Five participants took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences and opinions of the diagnostic process. A thematic analysis was conducted and the themes of Importance of Knowledge, Lack of Support After Diagnosis, Financial Cost vs Time, Relationship with other Conditions and Age and Autism were noted, with the Importance of Knowledge being split into two subthemes, self-knowledge and the knowledge of others. This research aimed to gain the opinion of individuals directly affected by the process of autism diagnosis by including them as much as possible in the research. It was found that participants believed that it is not exclusively females who struggle to gain a diagnosis but anyone out with the stereotyped autism phenotype. Future research should focus on gaining information from autistic individuals who are unable or uncomfortable communicating verbally. Furthermore, the information found in this research and others surrounding this needs to be implemented in provisions for autistic individuals. These provisions should reflect the diversities seen within the autistic community.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Can You Catch the Culprit? Age and Sex-Related Differences in Lie Detection Accuracy in High-Stake Settings</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Introduction:</strong> Understanding the factors affecting the ability to detect lies is particularly important in settings such as law enforcement. However, the majority of lie detection research has used low-stake (non-serious) rather than high-stake (serious) lies. Recent research indicates that high-stake settings may produce reliable cues indicative of deception that differ from those displayed in low-stake settings. <br><strong>Methods:</strong> Shaw and Lyonsâ (2017) high-stake study investigated the effects of age, deception cue knowledge and confidence on lie detection accuracy. To validate their findings, the current study replicated their design. Participants were sorted into a cue (given deception cues) or no cue (used instinct) condition, viewed 24 video-clips of individuals making appeals for missing or murdered people, and then determined whether the individual was lying or not, how confident they were of their decision and whether they recognised the case. Participants also reported cues they used when detecting deception. Adding to Shaw and Lyonsâ (2017) design the current study controlled for sex of both participants and people in video-clips. <br><strong>Results:</strong> In line with Shaw and Lyonsâ (2017) results, age was positively associated with lie detection accuracy and trivial effects were found for deception cue knowledge and confidence ratings. The effect of participantsâ sex on lie detection accuracy was trivial, however participants detected liars of the same sex better than the opposite sex. Participants who used head-movement and spoken-account cues were worse at detecting deception. In contrast, Shaw and Lyons (2017) found that participants were better at detecting deception when using emotion-based cues. <br><strong>Discussion:</strong> The study provides further support and insight into the factors influencing lie detection. The limitations of these findings, and potential implications for future research, are discussed with reference to relevant literature.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> NA</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The visual system constantly optimizes itself, creating predictions and internal models to understand, navigate, and survive the natural world even in the face of incomplete or missing information. The creation of internal models in the primary visual cortex though feedback connectivity has been well documented in recent years in light of a predictive processing framework. However, how these internal models are stored in long term memory is not so well understood. Here we use a novel behavioral line drawing paradigm to test how internal models are stored in memory. In our main experiment we presented 183 individuals with occluded stimuli and minutes later tested whether they could identify the stimuli that was previously occluded. Thus, we did not test individualsâ memory for images they had seen before but ones they had in fact never seen before - only merely predicted. We compared memory recollection between real images and line drawing internal model representations. Our findings show that participants can recognize real images in which they had never seen prior. Further we find that internal model memory is driven categorically or heuristically rather than feature specifically. We also may have evidence that the process of line drawing acts as an encoding mechanism for amodal completion.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Group Identification predicts Generalised Anxiety in the Student Population</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Previous research reports anxiety to be higher in those with lower group identification and higher levels of autistic traits. However, to date, no study has investigated all three variables in the student population. It was hypothesised that (H1) group identification would be negatively correlated to anxiety, and autistic traits would be positively correlated to anxiety. Additionally, it was hypothesised that (H2) group identification and autistic traits would significantly predict anxiety. 169 students (137 female; 27 male; 5 non-binary) aged 17 to 52 years answered three online self-report questionnaires. H1 was accepted, with a strong negative correlation reported between group identification and generalised anxiety, along with a moderate-to-strong positive correlation between autistic traits and generalised anxiety, providing supporting evidence in line with previous findings. H2 was partially accepted, as group identification significantly predicted anxiety, but autistic traits did not. Regression results support research indicating group identification is predictive of better mental health, but also contrast previous research which suggested higher autistic trait scores predict negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety. Finally, the hierarchical regression results suggest a full or partial mediation effect of GIS on AQ-10 scores in predicting anxiety, therefore future research is needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Alpha phase-behaviour correlations on visual and motor processing: a pilot EEG study</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Electrical brain oscillations reflect fluctuations in neural excitability. More than 90 years ago, fluctuations in the occipito-parietal alpha-frequency band (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, 8-12 Hz) have been hypothesized to act as a sensory cortex gateway to perception. Several past and recent studies have addressed this hypothesis by linking <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> oscillations to perception. However, despite this hypothesisâ long history and recent popularity, empirical evidence for it is still controversial and inconclusive. A common finding, is that the instantaneous phase of occipito-parietal <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> oscillations at visual stimulus onset, as recorded by extra-cranial electroencephalography (EEG), is correlated with the behavioral responses to that stimulus, such as required during visual detection tasks. This phase relationship with performance in visual tasks is usually interpreted in terms of an impact on perception. Yet, it is classically investigated in tasks requiring participants to produce a manual response upon visual stimulation. Accordingly, any <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> oscillation - response relationship may also reflect a pre-stimulus <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> phase influence on motor rather than visual processes, yet this has been largely ignored. Considering this gap in the literature, I aimed to tease apart the relationship between the pre-stimulus occipito-parietal <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> phase and visual/perceptual processing versus motor preparation. To this end, I recorded EEG in 4 participants performing a computerised behavioural task across three conditions. I predicted a significant phase opposition in the pre-stimulus occipito-parietal <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> phase, relative to the timing in which a voluntary motor act occurs, and/or the amplitude of a visual EEG response (the C1-component). I did not expect significant phase opposition relative to the Reaction Time (RT) to a visual stimulus, based on the inconsistency in existing literature. Yet, results did not provide strong evidence of phase opposition in any condition. Given the pilot nature of this study and the small sample size, results are not conclusive as to dis-proofing an effect and to challenge the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> phase-behaviour relationship meaningfully. I discuss individual patterns of the findings and make recommendations for future investigations of phase opposition in the sensorimotor cortex and/or in the theta (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, 4-8Hz) band.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Autistic Adultsâ Use of Dating Apps: A Mixed-Methods Study</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Although social-communication difficulties and differences are central to the clinical characterisation of autism, most autistic people desire romantic relationships. Previous studies indicate autistic people use internet dating, but no research has explored dating apps. All participants (n = 151) provided demographic information and completed a qualitative Dating App Survey. A subsample (n = 104) completed the Motivations for Dating App Use survey, the Autism Spectrum Quotient-10, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief instrument and the Autism Spectrum Quality of Life scale. Linear models showed no association between quality of life and dating app use, and most participants had no preference for their partnerâs neurotype. Minority status, safety issues, gamification of interactions and dating norms all negatively affected participantsâ dating app experiences. Online communication, meeting new people and clear boundaries were mentioned as benefits of dating apps. These findings suggest autistic people experience varied barriers and benefits to dating app use, and the implications are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Inclusive Gender Measures: âNon-binaryâ Option Improves Comfort, Ease and Accuracy in Answering Gender Questions for Transgender and Non-binary Participants</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Discussion of gender measures in psychology research has increased in recent years, yet there remains a lack of consensus, and dichotomous male/female measures remain the most commonly used. This study examines the impact of a ânon-binaryâ option, an âotherâ option and explicit trans inclusion (i.e.Â âmale (cis or trans)â) on comfort, ease, and accuracy of answering the question âWhat is your gender?â for transgender and non-binary participants. Participants answered 8 versions of the question, and then rated them on a 7-point Likert scale for each of the three aspects of answering experience. The results showed that only the ânon-binaryâ option had a significant impact, with an improvement in comfort, ease, and accuracy of answering observed. Presence of an âotherâ option and explicit trans inclusion had no significant effect. This suggests that addition of a ânon-binaryâ option to gender questions goes some way to alleviating the ethical issues associated with exclusive gender measures, without creating complicating data coding.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploring the Question of Temporal Accommodation in Conversation</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Speech is a fundamental feature of human communication. This is widely studied across numerous fields including Social Psychology, where previous research has provided substantial evidence of speakers altering their speech in order to resemble that of their interlocutor. The present study intended to explore whether synchronisation of cognitive processing and rhythm alignment occurs across speaking turns in a standard conversation as existing literature is limited by the use of musical stimuli in studies. This was assessed using spoken responses from a sample of 64 native English speakers who were presented with a series of auditory maths sums. It was hypothesised that speakers would respond more consistently on beat to an isochronous stimulus than they would to a beat that is jittered. Although, results revealed that this was not the case. Aligned with previous literature, additional analysis identified that entrainment could occur in an alternative way where listeners in fact produce faster speech in response to hearing a faster tempo. Outcomes of this research suggest the need for future study in order to investigate the role of temporal accommodation in conversations within more natural contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> What Features of Online Interaction Influence the Quality of Life of Autistic Youth?</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Background: </strong>Social interaction during adolescence is increasingly occurring online, due to technology development and the recent COVID-19 restrictions (Office for National Statistics, 2020; Ofcom, 2020). While some research has explored how this has affected neurotypical adolescents (Orben &amp; Przybylski, 2019), little has been done to understand how online interaction influences autistic youth. Current research is divided as to whether social media provides an âoptimalâ method for autistic communication (Benford &amp; Standen, 2009; Mazurek, 2013). Therefore, this study aimed to understand how online interaction influences autistic youthâs quality-of-life.<br></p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Non-autistic (N = 39) and autistic (N = 17) youth (ages 16-24) completed the Friendship Questionnaire (Baron-Cohen &amp; Wheelwright, 2003), the World Health Organisation Quality-of-Life-BREF scale (The WHOQOL Group, 1998) and reported their social media use. Autistic participants also completed the Autistic Spectrum Quality-of-Life domain (McConachie et al., 2018).<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>For both non-autistic and autistic participants, friendship scores and time spent on social media did not significantly predict quality-of-life. There was also no relationship between social media time and Autistic Spectrum Quality-of-Life scores. Qualitative analysis revealed the importance of autistic friendships, the influence of trust on communication preferences, the reduced reliance of masking behaviours online and the heterogeneity of communication preferences.<br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Participants revealed that social media provided a valuable, but not optimal, medium for social interaction. The lack of relationship between social media and quality-of-life for both groups suggest the relationship is complex and requires further study. Qualitative results reveal that online communication has some benefits over face-to-face communication, however, many participants preferred to communicate face-to-face with close friends. This suggests a benefit of online communication may be that it provides an escape from masking exhaustion, but face-to-face is preferred when participants do not feel pressured to mask.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Deception Perceptions in the Dark and the Light: An Investigation into the Dark and Light Triads</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> A new concept known as the Light Triad (faith in humanity, humanism, and Kantianism) has had little empirical research and requires further investigation. As the Light Triad is a conceptual contrast to the Dark Triad (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy), research is needed to study Dark and Light Triad traits in concert to provide meaningful comparisons between perceptual and behavioural differences. A plethora of research surrounding the Dark Triad and deception portrays mixed results. No research exists investigating the Light Triad and deception. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to investigate the Light Triad and deception, in turn adding to the nomological network surrounding the Light Triad. A further goal was to add to existing research surrounding the Dark Triad and deception to combat mixed results. Self-report scores were collected online (n = 249) by the Short Dark Triad measuring Dark Triad traits, Light Triad Scale measuring Light Triad traits, Lying in Every Life and an amended version of Lying in a High-Stake Scenario scales measuring perceptions of low-stake and high-stake deception, respectively. Overall, the Dark Triad was positively related to both low-stake and high-stake deception, and the opposite was conveyed for the Light Triad. However, not all findings were consistent with existing research and unexpected results were found for Light Triad traits to both low-stake and high-stake deception. The results highlight the importance of future research to continue adding to the nomological network of the Light Triad and combat mixed results found for the Dark Triad and deception.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic does not boost well-being: variability in the well-being benefits of prosocial behaviour</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research shows that behaving prosocially, i.e., for the benefit of others, not only increases the well-being of the recipient, but also of the helper. However, there is important variability in this effect and uncertainty about the conditions under which it occurs. The person-activity congruence model suggests acting in accordance with oneâs values enhances well-being. Accordingly, recent findings indicate that individualâs orientation toward happiness, which represents the way they pursue happiness, may further the well-being boosting effect of prosociality. The present study aimed to provide further evidence of that prosocial behaviour, in particular volunteering, is associated with enhanced subjective well-being and examine the moderating effect of two types of happiness orientation on this relationship. Participants (N = 59) completed online questionnaires assessing positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, and happiness orientation and were grouped into the prosocial condition (n = 29) or control condition (n = 30) based on their self-categorisation as volunteers. Contrary to expectations, the two conditions did not differ in their levels of subjective well-being or positive affect. The present study thus found no support for the claim that prosocial behaviour, here volunteering, is associated with benefits to helpersâ well-being. Moreover, because of the non-significant result it was not possible to use a regression model to establish the role of happiness orientation in this relationship. Consequently, this study could not support nor reject a person-activity congruence model of prosociality. There likely has been considerable influence of external variables such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the studyâs outcome, therefore the results must be interpreted with caution.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> A study investigating the new online university environment and the relationship between online engagement and perceived academic success in university students</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> This study examined how online engagement and non-academic influences affected perceived academic confidence and skill in 79 University of Glasgow psychology students. We measured academic online engagement, student perceived academic confidence, student perceived academic skill and non-academic influences such as sleep and exercise levels. Students who engaged in online content more and who had more of a positive association with non-academic influences experienced higher levels of perceived academic confidence. Higher levels of online engagement also predicted increased perceived academic skill levels. However, a more positive association with non-academic influences did not predict perceived academic skill levels. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that increased online engagement can significantly impact student development. In addition, our results indicate that the interconnectivity between these variables is an interesting and complex relationship. Therefore, future research in this area will be particularly valuable in order to gain a deeper understanding of how perceived academic success can be impacted by online engagement and non-academic influences and to explore the effect that this has on student development throughout their university career.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Vegans and omnivores are not homogenous groups: the influence of a vegan label and a foods presumed vegan status on food choice varies substantially</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Diet has been a focus of study due to the significant influence on our health, leading to an exploration of promoting healthy food choices. Health information labelling is the most widespread strategy of influencing peopleâs choices, with identity related goals established as salient moderators. However, the effects of a popular health label that also represents a stigmatised identity - the vegan label - have been ignored. Furthermore, food choice studies have received criticism in the past for inconsistent results. This study aims to investigate the impact of the vegan label on food choice and improve upon these studies by measuring for two previously unaccounted for extraneous variables. Dietary values are measured on a 6-point Likert-scale to account for individual differences and novel methodology measured a foodâs presumed dietary status (vegan or not vegan). Findings from participants (N = 719) concluded that overall, the omnivorous group chose significantly more food that was presumed vegan, while the plant-based group chose significantly more food with a vegan label. However, there were various effects within all 6 dietary groups. Findings and interpretations indicate there is a more nuanced understanding to the study of food choice, while also identifying that foods presumed dietary status, vegan label and dietary status on a continuum should be measured in future food choice studies.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> âIs this what I have to put my mind and body through? Are they asking this of me?â: Exploring undergraduate student experiences of high-level productivity</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Productivity is a complex construct that has not been fully investigated in qualitative psychological research. Current literature on productivity focuses on behavioural output and determines how good or bad productivity is from this output. Furthermore, we have limited understanding of how productivity and well-being interact. Therefore, existing research requires further investigation into motivational processes, diverse forms of productivity, and the direct relationship between productivity and well-being. The current study, situated in a critical realist perspective, explored undergraduate studentsâ lived experiences of high-level productivity. Research questions were designed to investigate motivational processes underlying high-level productivity; how healthy and toxic forms of high-level productivity differ; and the potential impact of high-level productivity on well-being. An online qualitative survey, created for this study, was completed by 38 participants. Data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, which produced three major themes. Theme 1, informed by Self-Determination Theory, proposed that motivation is need-based and choice-based. Theme 2 suggested that productivity is a persistent yet challenging process to maintain, and partially influenced by societal expectations to appear busy. Theme 3 identified that students prioritise productivity over well-being unless they have earned rest. These findings can inform policy and practice for institutional well-being guidelines, resources, and interventions.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Is an Online Intervention Effective at Improving Medical and Nursing Studentsâ Attitudes Toward Homelessness?</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> This study aims to investigate whether an online intervention is effective at improving both medical and nursing undergraduate studentsâ attitudes toward homelessness, as measured by the Attitudes Toward Homelessness Inventory (ATHI) (Kingree &amp; Daves, 1989). This is due to mixed findings of studies researching changes in attitudes toward homelessness after experiencing clinical rotations, and limited research into online interventions for homelessness within healthcare students. It is hypothesised that the online intervention will result in a significant improvement in attitudes toward homelessness for medical and nursing students, as measured by the ATHI, compared to the control group. Additionally, it is hypothesised that there will be a correlation between the year of study and the attitudes toward homelessness at Time 1. A 2x2 mixed experimental design was used to assess whether the online intervention improved attitudes toward homelessness. A total of 38 undergraduate medical and nursing students at the University of Glasgow volunteered to participate in the study. Participants provided demographic information and completed the ATHI (Time 1) before being randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Both groups watched a brief video, before being provided with an infographic to read and three comprehension questions to complete. The control group received a video and an infographic on climate change, whereas the experimental group received the intervention focussing on homelessness and health. One-week later participants completed the ATHI again (Time 2) before being debriefed. A one-way ANCOVA was carried out and found that the intervention did not significantly improve attitudes of medical and nursing students toward homelessness, compared to the control group, when controlling for Time 1 ATHI scores. A correlation test found no correlation between the year group and the ATHI scores at Time 1. The limitations of this study are discussed along with the implications, and areas for future research.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> An Exploration of the Effect of Gender Binary and Sexual Orientation on Attraction</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Previous research based on the psychology of attraction has led to various theories being formed. A prominent theory is that of physical attraction to sexual dimorphism; men are more attracted to feminine women, and women to masculine men. Studies testing this have found heterosexual men to be more attracted to sexually dimorphic women, with variations in heterosexual womenâs attraction. However, such studies tend not to include non-heterosexual or non-binary gendered people. The present study aims to bridge this gap in literature to explore whether someone having a non-binary gender affects how attractive they are perceived, as well as how attractive they perceive others to be. Results found that non-binary participants rated more people as attractive, as did non-heterosexual participants. There was also a significant interaction between target gender binary and participant sexuality, implying a unique experience of attraction by this group.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Where do âdarkâ personalities fall on the ladder of success? A study of the relationship between the Dark Triad and Career Success</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> A longstanding interest in uncovering the factors that facilitate or impede career success has been observed, with recent findings suggesting that the Dark Triad traits (Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism), might play an important role in determining career success. Previous studies have shown that Machiavellianism and narcissism have been positively related to career success outcomes, whereas psychopathy has been negatively related to them. Participants responded to a questionnaire assessing Dark Triad traits as well as extrinsic and intrinsic career success variables. Responses were collected from 201 participants working in the private, corporate sector of organisations in Cyprus, and were analysed using two different approaches. Analysis 1 employed a sample of 77 participants and Analysis 2 employed a sample of 172 participants, while the samples of both analyses were representative of the target population. Analysis was carried out using logistic and multiple linear regressions for each career success variable. The findings challenge the proposed hypotheses, as psychopathy is found to be positively related to career success, and Machiavellianism and narcissism to be partly negatively associated with career success. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings in organisations as well as potential limitations of the research are discussed. Future studies should employ larger and more diverse samples so as to explore these relationships longitudinally.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Barriers to Exercise: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of Studentâs Experiences</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Objectives: </strong>To understand the barriers students experience towards exercise, despite knowing the benefits it provides.<br></p>
<p><strong>Design: </strong>Exercise is crucial to combat the growing rate of non-communicable diseases and mental health struggles. Students are a group at-risk of reduced exercise and are also at a key timepoint for forming long-term health habits. Hence, it is essential to understand the exercise barriers they experience. Previous quantitative research has overlooked the complexity and personal nature of studentâs exercise barriers. Therefore, the present study has taken a qualitative approach to understand studentâs exercise experiences in depth and allow individual voices to be heard.<br></p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Six undergraduate students were selected using purposive sampling and each participated in a semi-structured interview exploring their exercise barriers. Photo-elicitation was used to enhance discussion and empower the participant. Transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>All participants experience a multitude of exercise benefits. Nevertheless, they would often not meet their exercise goals. Five themes addressing their barriers towards exercise were identified: exercise is not a priority, lack of a beneficial routine, âpeople like me donât exerciseâ, societal expectations and perceived social evaluation.<br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Students barriers to exercise are multifaceted and highly individualised. Listening to studentâs voices regarding this phenomenon has highlighted the need for targeted interventions. Potential strategies to help students overcome exercise barriers are explored.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> A meta-analysis to quantify lateralised spatial attention biases (pseudoneglect) in Alzheimerâs disease</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Healthy young adults display a visuospatial attention bias in favour of stimuli appearing to the left side of space, a phenomenon known as pseudoneglect. This bias is frequently affected by neurodegenerative diseases. However, the question remains as to whether pseudoneglect is preserved in Alzheimerâs disease (AD) patients due to mixed reporting of rightward, leftward and no spatial biases in previous studies. Hence, the present meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether AD patients exhibit a group-level lateralised spatial attention bias, as marked by line bisection performance. A total of 10 datasets from 9 studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, totalling 325 AD patients. No spatial bias to either side of space was identified in the overall analysis, or with exclusion of the one posterior cortical atrophy study. The overall heterogeneity was moderate and no publication bias was present, suggesting the effect sizes of studies included in the meta-analysis are fairly representative of the literature. Furthermore, a comparison of the spatial bias in AD patients and healthy older adults revealed considerable overlap between the two confidence intervals, suggesting they demonstrate similar spatial biases to one another. There was no moderating influence of the participantsâ age, although there was a moderating influence of the percentage of males. The lower the percentage of males in a study, the stronger and more rightward the overall bias was - more research is needed to ascertain any disease-specific sex-differences. In addition to this, a focus on characterising the spatial bias in subtypes of AD and dementia, as well as throughout the stages of AD is recommended for future research in order to maximise diagnostic potential.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Loudness of Voice Predicts Sub-Clinical Depressive Symptoms in a Reading Task</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Depression impacts an individualâs mood, cognition and motor ability greatly affecting both the individual and society. Psychomotor retardation, impaired cognition and motor ability, as a symptom of depression may affect vocal production. This paper aimed to investigate whether there was a significant association between depressive symptoms and multiple vocal acoustics in a non-clinical sample. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to establish whether depressive symptoms could be predicted by voice. Participants (n = 24) were recruited via social media and the University of Glasgowâs participant pool. Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale and recorded their voice reading the Rainbow Passage via remote participation. Multiple regression revealed support only for loudness being predictive of depressive symptoms. No support was found for other vocal acoustics being predictive of depressive symptoms. This study has implications on the theory of psychomotor symptoms in depression and their potential link to vocal production. In addition, this paper highlights potential task effects which have led to inconsistent findings as well as future implications of the present study.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Fatigue in the Student Population during COVID-19</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> There is a distinct lack of research on fatigue expression in the general population, as well as in students. While models exist that attempt to explain fatigue in various populations, such as individuals with chronic conditions or mental health disorders (Corwin et al., 2002; Long et al., 2016), they have been found to poorly explain fatigue in the general population. The aim of this study is to examine fatigue in the general and student population during COVID-19. A fatigue battery of six different questionnaires (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Chalder Fatigue Scale and Fatigue Questionnaire, Toronto Hospital Alertness Test, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Barrow Neurological Institute Fatigue Scale) was used to evaluate the dimensionality of fatigue in the general population. While results from the principal component analysis (PCA) suggest a unidimensional concept, some evidence was found for a multidimensional approach when seven factors were forced. Furthermore, independent sample t-tests found a statistically significant difference in mental fatigue in the student population compared to the non-student population. However, no such difference was found in sustained fatigue, sleepiness, or physical fatigue. Implications of these results are discussed. A simultaneous qualitative study was conducted, consisting of interviews with students at universities in Glasgow and analysed through thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006). Results suggest that students struggled to adjust their fatigue reduction techniques to accommodate COVID-19 restrictions. Furthermore, students had to learn to navigate inadequate boundaries between work and personal life, handle the consequences of their new schedules, and cope with changes to their personal student identity. It is recommended that universities consider how students are coping with the global pandemic in order to effectively support them in completing university online.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Brand Bias Susceptibility: The Mediating Roles of Consumer Age, Gender and Personality Traits</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Over the past two decades, a vast amount of research has demonstrated the influence of individual differences, such as age and gender, on consumer decision making. Likewise, cross-disciplinary research has demonstrated the impact of branding in biasing consumer decisions. However, to date, little research has examined the mediating role of individual differences in determining susceptibility to the brand bias. Therefore, an experiment was designed to investigate whether brand bias susceptibility differs significantly across age, gender and personality traits of the consumer. A series of binary choice tasks between two clothing items measured whether participants would choose a lesser quality branded product over a higher quality unbranded product and in doing so indicate a brand bias. The Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) were measured with the 60-item Big Five Inventory-2 questionnaire. The results found a significant correlation between age (range = 19 - 72 years) and brand bias; as age increased, brand bias decreased. From the personality traits, a significant negative relationship was found between Openness and brand bias, while the other four personality traits showed no significant correlation with brand bias. Lastly, analysing gender differences indicated that male participants were significantly more influenced by the brand bias than female participants. Taken together, these results suggest that brand bias susceptibility does differ across age, gender and personality traits. Further scientific research will be able to use these findings to build upon the knowledge of individual differences in consumer decision making, and brand marketers will be able to leverage this knowledge to optimise their marketing strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on perceived employability of university students: A comparison between Psychology and Business School students</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research suggests that various factors of student employability have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic implying that student employability may be affected as well. Additionally, extensive research compares different employability enhancing approaches between universities, however not within universities. The support students receive might influence how the pandemic affects their employability. Thus, the current study aimed to examine how the pandemic influenced studentsâ perceived employability, comparing studentsâ perceptions from different Schools within a Scottish University, who have access to different employability support depending on School. 4 Business School and 4 Psychology students took part in semi-structured interviews where they discussed how the pandemic affected their employability and what support their Schools provides them. Thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) was applied to the data following transcription of the audio-recorded interviews. The analysis identified 6 overarching themes, Traditional and New Skills, Changing Networking Opportunities, Effects of No Experience, Difficulties of Online Teaching, Employability Support Provided, and Employability Support Needed. The analysis revealed differences and similarities between Psychology and Business School students in their perceptions of the pandemicâs impact on their employability and the support they receive. Implications of the findings are discussed along with the limitations of the study and the methodology applied.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Age-Related Trust Bias Within Voice Perception: An Investigation into Underlying Perceptual and Cognitive Processes</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Previous research has demonstrated that individuals exhibit an increase in trust as they grow older, referred to as the age-related trust bias. However, the underlying mechanisms by which this bias arises are relatively unclear. Thus, focusing on the age-related trust bias specifically within voice perception, the current study investigated the influence of age on underlying perceptual and cognitive processes which affect trustworthiness judgements of voices. 36 young listeners and 38 older listeners were presented with 30 male voice recordings saying the word âhelloâ. All listeners rated each voice on perceived trustworthiness (i.e.Â the proxy of perceptual processes), and participated in a Dictator Game in which they indicated how much hypothetical money they would give to each voice (i.e.Â the proxy of cognitive processes). Spearman correlations showed that: 1) young and older listeners heard the voices as projecting similar levels of trust; 2) young and older listeners gave money to the voices in a similar manner; and 3) there was no difference between the relationship of age and trustworthiness ratings and the relationship of age and amount of money given. In short, our results suggest that the age-related trust bias within voice perception is not a result of differences in underlying perceptual or cognitive processing between young and older adults. Our findings are discussed in relation to existing theoretical concepts, and directions for future research are suggested.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretations: The Role of a Rationale</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The present study explored the effect that including a brief psychoeducational rationale prior to Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretations (CBM-I) had on its effectiveness at reducing negative interpretation bias. It was hypothesised that a comprehensive rationale for treatment would increase its efficacy by increasing user engagement in the process. A between-subjects design was utilised, and a convenience sample of adults (N = 60) was gathered. The control and experimental groups differed only in the amount of relevant information they were given prior to completing CBM-I. Participants completed a version of the Word Sentence Association Paradigm before and after treatment to measure their level of negative interpretation bias. A bootstrap t-test was conducted on the 20% trimmed means of either group, which revealed a 95% confidence interval of [3.33, 27.41], hence providing support for this studyâs hypothesis. This provides preliminary evidence that including a rationale increases CBM-Iâs effectiveness at modifying interpretation biases, however, it warrants replication in a clinical sample to establish if this effect holds for individuals with mood or anxiety disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Effect of Anthropomorphic Facial Texture on the Perception of Conversational Facial Expression Models Displayed on a 3D Social Robot</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Facial expressions are an integral part of daily social communication. However, such a humane phenomenon is difficult to apply to social robots. Little is known about the effect that human-likeness of a 3D social agent has on the perception of conversational facial expression models. We address this knowledge gap by exploring the effect of anthropomorphic facial textures on perception of conversational facial expressions. Using a data-driven approach, we modelled facial expression models of âthinkingâ, âinterestedâ, âboredâ, and âconfusedâ directly from participants. These were transferred and displayed onto the 3D social robot and shown to participants with a random Furhat face texture. Participants indicated whether they thought the conversational facial expression model displayed correctly matched the facial expression word accompanying on a separate screen. Results showed that human facial textures displayed more accurate perceptions of facial expression models. A further analysis into this, however, showed that the texture failed to hold significance in the perception of the expressions. However, the expressions themselves had significance. A post-hoc test and further accuracy analysis showed that some facial expression models are perceived more easily on social robots than others. These could also facilitate or hinder perceptions of these expressions in robot-human communication. Our results demonstrate the continued research must be undertaken in understanding the effects of physical appearance of 3D social robots and how conversational facial expression models can encourage this conversational pathway.</p>

This exploratory study aimed to investigate the constructs of independence and dependence in programmes watched by children.<br></p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>This study was a secondary data analysis of childrenâs favourite things to watch, as chosen by children themselves. A new protocol was developed in accordance with the literature and pilot research in order to effectively analyse both the independent and dependent behaviours of male and female characters in 64 different programmes.<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Programmes watched by boys featured higher instances of both independent and dependent behaviours across all characters. Additionally, programmes watched by younger boys also featured increased instances of independent and dependent behaviours. While not statistically significant, it was also suggested that male characters across all programmes acted in more independent ways than female characters, and female characters acted in more dependent ways than male characters.<br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>The findings of this study suggest that the presence of gender stereotypes in the programmes watched by children, namely in relation to the constructs of independence and dependence, will impact their social development. This may differ culturally however, thus highlighting the need for similar research in different cultural contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Moving beyond âscreen timeâ, encapsulating the importance of content, context and individual differences: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of adolescentâs social media experiences and their relationship with wellbeing and sleep</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> There has recently been a shift in the research domain towards a more holistic view of adolescentâs social media engagement, moving beyond screen time. However, there is a lack of adolescent perspectives informing this new approach. The current study adds to the literature by offering individualised interpretations of social media experiences and their relationship with wellbeing and sleep. Six adolescents (4 females, 2 male) aged 15-18 participated in one-one semi-structured interviews on Zoom, exploring both day and night SM habits. Interviews incorporated photo-elicitation methodology, whereby participants presented photographs of their online experiences to help prompt dialogue. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis produced four superordinate themes: âTaking Control Over Engagementâ, âOnline Presentation: Understanding Authenticityâ, âSleep Implicationsâ and âEscapismâ. All themes highlight the multifaceted nature of adolescentâs social media use, with many reporting both positive and negative experiences with various aspects of social media. Crucially, while the lived experiences of adolescents varied, it was evident that the most important determinants for wellbeing and sleep outcomes were underlying factors and the context in which user behaviours occurred. Collectively, analyses support the research shift away from screen time and suggest that reframing the negative narrative around teens social media use is crucial. The current findings are discussed in terms of the studyâs limitations, implications as well as directions for future research.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Great Sexpectations? An Investigation into How Demographic and Personality Factors May Influence Motivations Behind Why People Engage in Sexual Intercourse</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Background:</strong> Historically, the motivations behind why individuals choose to engage in sexual intercourse have been considered simple and few. However, more recent literature has suggested that these motivations may in fact be greater in number and more psychologically complex. Past literature has indicated that demographic and personality factors may influence these motivations. The current study aims to investigate the motivations behind why individuals choose to engage in sexual intercourse, and the extent to which demographic factors and personality factors influence these motivations. <br><strong>Methods:</strong> 469 participants (347 female and 122 male), completed a number of questionnaires investigating demographic information, religiosity, measured on the Self Report Religiosity Scale, personality, measured on the Big Five Inventory 2 (Short Version) and sexual motivations, measured on the YSEX?-SF scale. Four multiple regressions were calculated.<br><strong>Results:</strong> Four significant regression models were found. Many demographic and personality factors were found to be significant predictors of a number of factors within the YSEX?-SF; physical motivations, goal attainment motivations, emotional motivations and insecurity motivations. Religiosity was found to be a significant predictor of physical, goal attainment and emotional motivations. Similarly, sexual experience was found to be a significant predictor of goal attainment, emotional and insecurity motivations. Several personality traits were found to be significant predictors of both physical and insecurity motivations. <br><strong>Discussion:</strong> Many of the findings in the current study have been supported by existing literature in the area. A new finding surrounding the personality traits of low agreeableness and high openness as potential risk factors for experiencing sexual violence, was identified and discussed. Recommendations for further study include investigating the interaction between predictor variables and their influence on motivations behind why individuals may choose to engage in sexual intercourse.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> âJust keep pushing and try to be the bestâ: a qualitative exploration of how Black women gain positive visibility within UK higher education settings</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> As a result of intersectional invisibility, Black women continue to be excluded, marginalised and overlooked within the UK higher education (HE) sector. Gaining positive visibility is imperative for Black women to be recognised as competent academics, change the prejudiced perspectives of those holding them back, and advance their careers within HE. Though existing literature provides a preliminary understanding of how Black female academics gain such visibility, the current study aims to extend knowledge in this area by exploring what strategies Black women of all academic levels use, and whether previous experience with gendered racism has any effect on the strategies utilised. Utilising an embedded mixed-methods design, this study explored the lived experiences of 47 Black female academics across the UK. Reflexive thematic analysis identified six themes: working twice as hard; being prepared; avoiding stereotypes; breaking down stereotypes; support and networking; and remaining invisible. Results of the Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale showed that previous experience with gendered racism does have some influence over the use of the âavoiding stereotypesâ and âsupport and networkingâ strategies, with a multiple regression highlighting the roles of age and ethnicity within these relationships. The findings are discussed in terms of their impact on Black womenâs mental wellbeing, implications for current diversity management practices, and scope for future research.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> An Investigation into Mental Health Stigmatisation: The Impact of Disgust Sensitivity and Pathogen Cues</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Dawydiak et al.Â (2020) found that pathogen disgust is positively associated with stigmatisation of mental health conditions. This study investigated the same concepts in relation to a wider range of mental health conditions. Furthermore, it determined whether the presence of a pathogen cue in mental health condition vignettes interacted with the relationship between pathogen disgust and stigma. An online survey measuring the three domains of disgust (sexual, moral, pathogen) and stigmatisation towards four mental health conditions was completed by 208 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to vignettes with or without pathogen cues for each mental health condition. Linear regression analysis was employed to explore relationships between three types of disgust sensitivity and presence of pathogen cue on stigmatisation of four mental health conditions. Pathogen disgust was a significant predictor of stigma towards anorexia, depression, schizophrenia and skin picking disorder, while sexual and moral disgust were not. Presence of a pathogen cue explained significant variance in relation to skin picking disorder. A 2x4 analysis of variance explored the interaction between stigmatisation towards the four mental health conditions, type of mental health condition and presence or absence of pathogen cue. There was a main effect of mental health condition with greater stigma towards schizophrenia than other conditions. There was no significant interaction between pathogen cue and type of mental health condition. The results align with research showing that overgeneralisation of disease avoidance may be relevant for understanding stigma towards mental health conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Literature has recognised that participating in team sport can have positive implications for an individualâs sense of belonging and mental health. However there has been a gap in the literature on the topic regarding university students. This study focuses on male students. Two focus groups were conducted, each consisting of 7 participants who participated in team sport at university. Thematic Analysis was applied to collected data and four main themes emerged from the analysis: 1) Meeting New People and Building Relationships 2) Experience Sharing 3) Social Identity 4) Mental Health Implications. These data are discussed together with existing literature. Limitations, possible implications, and potential directions of future research are also discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Role of Modality and Quality of Social Interaction in Predicting Well-Being: An Experience Sampling Study</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Well-being predicts important life outcomes such as positive mental health. Therefore, it is vital to understand both well-being and the factors that influence it. Social interaction is one of the strongest predictors of well-being. However, controversy remains over the importance of interaction quality and the role of technology-mediated interaction. Additionally, the field suffers from methodological shortcomings. Consequently, in this exploratory study, 34 participants took part in a 7-day experience sampling protocol, which examined the role of quality and method of interaction in predicting subjective well-being. To account for the nested data structure, linear mixed-effects models were used to analyse the data. Face-to-face interaction was the only method of interaction that predicted well-being. In addition, the role of interaction quality differed between methods of interaction. Moreover, in some cases, quality items were interdependent. Results demonstrate the need for longitudinal designs and support recent research by suggesting that although technology-mediated interaction is not comparable to face-to-face interaction, deterministic accounts of technology-mediated interaction may be exaggerated. Additionally, results indicate the need to study both relational and conversational interaction quality while distinguishing between different methods of interaction. Future confirmatory studies with large, diverse samples, and objective measures are needed to support and extend current findings.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> People make rapid personality attributions about others based on their facial features. Fundamental social trait dimensions (dominance, competence, trustworthiness, and warmth) underly these personality trait attributions. There is growing evidence to question the generalisability of these trait dimensions across male and female perceivers. Consequently, this study aimed to explore sex differences in social trait perception. Moreover, this study also explored sex differences in the use of facial cues during social perception. Thirty participants (15 female, mean age = 23.77 years) observed male and female faces and rated them on social trait dimensions. A general linear model revealed that female participantâs show significantly increased perception of all the trait dimensions. We did not observe significant differences in male and female participantâs cross trait correlations. Further results suggest that there are sex differences in the use of cues to perceive trustworthiness, warmth and competence trait dimensions. Our findings suggest that perceiver gender impacts social trait perception in both the behavioural perception of social traits dimensions and the facial cues used. We discuss our findings with references to gender norm endorsement and sex differences in sensitivity to valance and dominance cues.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Gender Measures Compared: How Free Response Formats Can Help Tackle Invisibility of Non-binary and Genderqueer Individuals in Research</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Commonly used categorical measures of gender provide only limited response options and are exclusive of non-binary and genderqueer individuals making them invisible in research. More inclusive gender measures have been suggested and a free response format has been recommended. However, no previous studies have assessed how gender measures make non-binary and genderqueer participants invisible and no insights exists on how they respond to gender questions with exclusive response options. To answer this question, participants (n = 924) responded to a Binary, a Short and a LongList, and a Free Response gender assessment format. Additionally, participants rated how represented they felt by the options provided by each format and were asked for additional comments. The results show that the majority of Non-binary (n = 323) participants opted to use binary response options when no non-binary options were available. The Free response and the Long list were most sensitive to recording Non-binary participants and both Binary (n = 519) and Non-binary participants felt most represented by the Free response question. The objection that free response gender questions cause an increase in missing data is found to be unsupported and the concern that responses are too time-consuming or difficult to code is addressed. It is concluded that a free response question accompanied by guidance on why gender is assessed and how responses will be coded is a gender assessment format that is both feasible to process and inclusive of non-binary and genderqueer individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Class of COVID-19: An investigation into test anxiety and online exams during a global pandemic</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption to higher education. Subsequently, universities replaced traditional face-to-face exams with online exams. There is little research investigating studentâs test anxiety in online exams during the pandemic. Previous research has shown that COVID-19 has exacerbated studentsâ anxiety levels and that increased general anxiety can increase test anxiety. However, completing online exams has shown to significantly reduce test anxiety. Firstly, this study aimed to investigate if there was a difference in self-reported anxiety for online exams during COVID-19 compared to face-to-face exams. And secondly, to investigate what significantly predicted preference for online exams or face-to-face exams. Test anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety scores were calculated, and regression analyses assessed multiple predictor variables for test anxiety and preference for online or face-to-face exams regarding exam preparation, exam performance, exam anxiety and preferred format. A sample including 208 university students (ages 18-36) completed an online survey, collecting data regarding demographic information, COVID-19 anxiety, exam information, test anxiety and overall preferred exam format. Results confirmed the gender difference in test anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety. Informing our first aim, students reported less anxiety for online exams in comparison to face-to-face exams. Informing our second aim, no variables significantly predicted preference for online or face-to-face exams. However, GPA and COVID-19 anxiety significantly predicted test anxiety. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety and test anxiety positively correlated. Findings were discussed in relation to the research aims, the studyâs strengths and limitations. The implications of exploratory COVID-19 research for the future of higher education and suggestions for future research are proposed. This study concluded that students were less anxious for online exams but did not have an overall preference for online or face-to-face exams.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> How do Meat eaters and Vegans Think About Different Foods?</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Reducing meat consumption is imperative to limit greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further warming of the earthâs atmosphere. Investigating how people think about food will help us understand why many do not follow a plant-based diet, despite its benefits. This study used a feature listing task to examine how meat eaters and vegans represent meat and plant-based food, and the relation this has to eating motivations. 220 participants were presented with a range of food dishes and instructed to list features that describe each dish. Features were coded into categories and analysed quantitatively. Eating motives were assessed using a questionnaire. Results showed that both groups think about foods in their diet, and foods they find attractive, in terms of the consumption experience. Foods outside a personâs diet were thought about in terms of features independent of a specific situation. When making a food choice, both groups were equally motivated by factors relating to the consumption experience, but vegans had greater environmental and ethical motivations than meat eaters. There was no relationship between eating motives and feature listing responses - those with long-term eating motivations (e.g.Â health and ethics) did not implicitly think about food any differently than those with more immediate motivations (e.g.Â liking and hunger). The study provides evidence that spontaneous eating simulations occur when a person thinks about the food they eat, regardless of diet or explicit eating motivations. This could have important implications for the promotion of sustainable diets.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Mediating Effects of Sleep-Related Worry and Perfectionism Between OCD traits And Insomnia</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Insomnia has been associated with anxiety-related disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Investigations regarding the mediating effects between OCD symptoms and insomnia have often focused on anxiety and depression, whereas there is a lack of research investigating the mediating effects of perfectionism and sleep-related worry (SRW) between OCD symptoms and insomnia. This study aimed to assess the relationship between studentâs OCD symptoms, perfectionism, and sleep-related worries between their symptoms of insomnia. 74 undergraduate and postgraduate university students completed the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale; the Sleep Condition Indicator; the Almost Perfect Scale Revised; and the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire. A multiple linear regression showed that increased SRW and perfectionism were associated with increased symptoms of insomnia, but there was no relationship between OCD symptoms and insomnia symptoms. Mediation analysis did reveal that OCD symptoms were associated with increased insomnia symptoms through increased perfectionism, but not SRW. Those with OCD may misinterpret the perfectionist thoughts associated with not being able to achieve high standards, generating anxiety and a level of cognitive arousal that disrupts sleep. Additionally, SRW may disrupt sleep through an over-evaluation of the consequences of poor sleep, thus maintaining an arousal state that continues to delay sleep onset, providing more time which an individual might spend attempting to fall asleep and thus worrying about sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Cue or Noise: A Computational Analysis of Within-Speaker Variability and its Role in Voice Identity Perception</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research on voice identity perception has extensively studied between-speaker variability in an attempt to understand how listeners tell people apart. Within-speaker variability, the way the same voice varies across situations, has mostly been eliminated in these studies, effectively treating it as a form of random noise that impairs voice identity perception. However, recent studies focusing on the ability to tell people together suggest that within-speaker variability is speaker-specific and plays an equally important role in identifying others. This study attempted to quantitatively verify these claims by training and testing a machine-learning model on variable and non-variable voice samples, examining emerging differences in identification accuracy based on differences in their training and test sets. Our results revealed that the complexity of variable voices makes them more difficult to identify compared to non-variable voices. However, the model was also able to extract speaker-specific information from variable voice samples that improved identification accuracy for variable voices. These findings show that within-speaker variability provides important cues for the identification of naturally varying voices, highlighting the need for further research on its role in voice identity perception, as well as demonstrating how the use of machine-learning models can benefit future psychological research.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Zero to Hero: An exploration into the representation of male and female characters within popular childrenâs entertainment, and the emergence of gender stereotypes</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> In todayâs climate, the media has become a vital source of information that shapes childrenâs understanding and perceptions of gender. Prevailing literature emphasises the underrepresentation and stereotyped portrayals of female characters within childrenâs entertainment, with their presence only serving to reinforce a male-dominated narration. The current study explores the existence of such disparities in childrenâs favourite television and films of today, given that traditional gender roles are diminishing in society than recognised in prior research. I performed a content analysis on a sample of 65 television programmes, films and media identified by children - investigating the proportion of male and female characters in lead, minor and title roles, and the various descriptive roles they fulfilled. I aimed to investigate how this interacted with childrenâs character and watching preferences. The analysis indicated that there continues to be an underrepresentation of women on screen - with female characters outnumbered in lead, minor and title roles. While gender-role stereotypes persisted in the current sample of programmes, there were noticeable improvements in the types of roles and occupations portrayed characters, and the emergence of counter-gender stereotyped characters also. The significance of this is discussed in relation to childrenâs gender identity, role-models, and implications to mental health.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Effects of Media on Peopleâs Attitudes and Anxiety Towards Robots</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Robots are increasingly becoming a part of modern society. To get the most benefits from robots, it is imperative to understand where peopleâs attitudes towards robots derive from. The current study aimed to replicate and expand on Sundar et al.âs (2016) findings on the effects of media on peopleâs anxiety and attitudes towards robots, and subsequently, the probability of getting a robot (adoption intentions). A sample of 192 participants completed a free recall task and various questionnaires assessing robots in film/television experiences (including sympathy towards robots, character types, and appearance of recalled robots), attitudes towards robots, and contact with real robots. Stepwise regression analyses found that only perceived sympathy significantly predicted attitudes towards robots; not the amount of recalled media, appearance, or character type of robots. Anxiety predicted lower levels of perceived ease of use and usefulness of robots, while negative attitudes only predicted perceived usefulness of companion robots. Perceived usefulness predicted adoption intentions of both assistant and companion robots, while ease of use only predicted adoption intentions of companion robots. The findings are discussed in relation to other studies in the area and limitations and future directions are presented.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Red or Black Swans: A Study of Casino Gambling Behaviour During Times of Uncertainty</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Recently it seems that the world has gone through an increasing number of unforeseen and widely felt events. These events, dubbed Black Swan events by risk specialist N.N. Taleb, have given rise to a growing body of research dedicated towards identifying these Black Swans as early as possible and mitigating the risks they present. Some groups, however, such as individual investors within the stock trade, appear to be less affected by these risks than others. By using time series analysis of secondary data provided by an operating casino, this paper aimed to identify if this resilience towards Black Swan events also exists within a gambling population. Gamblers did appear to show some level of resilience towards these unpredictable events, leading to the suggestion that gambling itself encouraged resilience under these conditions and that frequent gamblers may be examples of antifragile personalities, best equipped to thrive in uncertain circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Investigating the Implications of Gender Stereotyped Appearances of Characters in Television Programmes Watched by Children</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Children spend a considerable amount of their downtime watching television programmes. Research suggests that within these programmes, children are being exposed to a range of gender stereotypes. This present study conducts a secondary data analysis on data collected in 2018 and 2020 by Dr Patersonâs lab at the University of Glasgow, to explore the differences in gender stereotypes surrounding charactersâ appearance in programmes watched by girls, boys and those watched by both genders using a protocol that measures charactersâ appearances. A one-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference in gender stereotyped appearances of characters in the programmes watched by the three groups, with characters in programmes watched by girls being more gender stereotyped. Further exploration of the appearance of lead and support characters showed there were statistically significant differences in gender stereotyped appearance of lead characters between the groups, but no significant findings were found for the support characters. From these data it was concluded that within childrenâs programmes, gender stereotypes related to charactersâ appearances are very much apparent and highlights the potential negative effects such stereotypes could be having on childrenâs development. The findings are discussed in terms of the implications that gender stereotypes could be having on children and ideas are suggested on how future research could further investigate gender stereotypes in childrenâs television programmes.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Social Owls and Larks: the Relationship between Circadian Chronotype and Social Media Use, and its Effect on Sleep Quality</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Previous studies have identified both circadian chronotype and social media use to be strong determinants of sleep quality; however, there is a lack of research directly investigating the relationship between the two. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to explore the association between circadian chronotype and social media use and its effect on sleep quality. For this reason, 150 university students, aged 18 to 25, completed a survey consisting of several self-report questionnaires. Circadian chronotype was measured by the Morningess-Eveningness Questionnaire. Social media use was assessed by a single-item questionnaire asking for hours per day spent on social media. Sleep quality was determined by the Sleep Condition Indicator. A multiple regression analysis revealed a significant effect of circadian chronotype on sleep quality (t = 2.75, p = .007), which implied that the Evening-type chronotype is associated with poorer sleep. Effects of social media use (t = 1.408, p = .161) and the interaction between circadian chronotype and social media use (t = -1.552, p = .123) on sleep quality were non-significant. An exploratory analysis comparing subjective estimates and objectively collected data of social media use showed a significant difference between the two (t(113) = 5.11, p &lt; .001), suggesting that participants, on average, overestimate the time spent on social media. Our findings stress the importance of addressing the detrimental effects of the Evening-type chronotype on sleep quality in students with appropriate instruments and employing objective measures of social media use. Suggestions for future research include, but are not limited to, taking the timing of social media use into consideration and studying this association in qualitatively different samples.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> A wealth of prior research has established that speakers of nonstandard dialects are evaluated differently from speakers of standard language forms on personality and emotional expression, but research on written forms of these dialects is scarce. An exploratory between-subjects study was conducted with both Scottish and non-Scottish volunteer participants in order to explore the effect of written Scottish Dialect, as compared to Standard English, on evaluations of status, solidarity and emotional intensity. It was predicted that Scottish Dialect would be downgraded on status and solidarity relative to Standard English, subject to the effects of in-group favouritism from Scottish participants. Additionally, it was predicted that non-Scottish participants would perceive Scottish Dialect as less emotionally intense than Standard English, while Scottish participants would perceive it as more emotionally intense. Results showed that Scottish Dialect was evaluated significantly lower on status than Standard English, subject to the expected interactions, but failed to find significant main effects for solidarity and emotional intensity. These results provide support for the persistence of cultural prejudice against nonstandard dialects in written contexts, but future research is recommended to further examine the disparities between written and spoken dialect.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> What Role Does Loneliness Play in the Relationship Between Insomnia and Feelings of Defeat and Entrapment in Young Adults?</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Insomnia is robustly associated with several psychopathologies and elevated suicide risk. The disorder is being diagnosed at increasing rates in young adult populations with corresponding drastic public health consequences as exemplified by the current oversaturation of mental health services. Despite this, a dearth of research addresses mechanisms underlying these associations. Previous literature which employs the Integrated-Motivational-Volitional Theory of Suicidal Behaviour and Social Rank Theory suggests perceptions of defeat and entrapment play an integral role in the relationships observed between both insomnia and psychopathology and insomnia and suicide, although little is known about the factors which contribute to their development. Recent research implicates loneliness as one such possible factor. This study aimed to ascertain whether loneliness mediated the relationship between insomnia and defeat and between defeat and entrapment in young adults. Young adult volunteers aged between 18 and 24 (n = 90) were recruited online and completed four self-report measures which assessed insomnia symptoms (Sleep Condition Indicator), feelings of defeat (The Defeat Scale), feelings of entrapment (The Entrapment Scale) and loneliness severity (UCLA Loneliness Scale). Simple mediation analysis indicated that loneliness fully mediates the relationship between insomnia and defeat and partially mediates the relationship between defeat and entrapment. Such findings extend theoretical knowledge, especially with regards to the IMV, and have important implications regarding therapeutic interventions. They suggest loneliness be a target of novel and existing therapies to help mitigate perceptions of defeat and entrapment and consequently, to prevent poor affective outcomes linked to an insomnia diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The aim of this study was to shine a much-needed light on the first had experiences of barriers and facilitators undergone by Scottish care leavers in response to drastic attrition rates despite resent policy advancements in eligibility. As a result of low sample turn out, three individuals where interviewed using vignettes intended for focus groups. The themes elicited varied largly between participants, however analysis derived five unanimous themes included pre-existing trauma, stigma, relationships, and grey areas. The underlying psychological processes to which these themes utilise to enact their roles as barriers and or facilitators are discussed. The present study concludes the constitution of barriers to aftercare support to involve a disregard for the individuality of care leavers in their traumatic experiences; stigmatisation; need for affective support; and legal variability care leavers; while facilitators act in the contrary. Resulting implications and future directions, include a need for experience lead research and a support structure that reflects individual needs rather than facilitating boreoarctic requirements of provision.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Validating a mental health scale to measure peer support and interaction for students in a university setting</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Many university students struggle with mental health difficulties. Social support is an important component of handling the stressors of an academic environment and any mental health issues. Students with mental health issues often report lower levels of social support. We developed a vignette questionnaire for measuring social support tailored to a university setting. It evaluates the willingness of students to interact with and support peers suffering from anxiety and depression. The scale is validated by comparing anxiety and depression scores to the established Generalized Anxiety Stigma Scale and the Depression Stigma Scale. 104 (M age = 21.7) participants took part in the study, of which 11 did not complete the control vignette. We found that anxiety and depression scores were significantly correlated with the established GASS and DSS according to Pearsonâs correlation method. A T-test showed that control scores differed significantly from the anxiety and depression scores. This suggests that peer treatment of students is correlated with peer attitudes towards mental health. We recommend this scale to be used to measure the effectiveness of a mental health initiative targeting social support.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Implicit Learning Effects in Rating Situated Motives of Eating over Multiple Timepoints</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Inconsistencies between theoretical conceptualisations and empirical findings for eating habits limit the holistic assessment and subsequent development of effective behaviour change interventions. To address these issues, the current study applied the novel Situated Assessment Method (SAM<sup>2</sup>) and investigated hypotheses of large individual differences, influential predictors, and implicit learning about eating motives. As part of a two-week investigation on eating and COVID-stress motives, 63 UK-based adults rated consumed food amount and its grounded predictors taste, fillingness, automaticity, healthiness, emotional satisfaction, and self-identity on 16 representative food groups. Additional ratings for the experimentally manipulated control condition COVID-stress assessed the generalisability of learning effects. Group-level, mixed-effect regression models explained large differences for individual eating motives at all timepoints, specifically establishing the importance of automaticity and taste. Despite limited awareness about the importance of predictors, increases in associative strength suggested repetition-induced implicit learning about eating motives but less about COVID-stress motives. These results not only address issues of operationalisation but highlight the ability of repeated SAM<sup>2</sup> assessments to capture eating habit profiles and induce implicit learning about underlying motives. To establish SAM<sup>2</sup> as an effective tool for eating behaviour interventions, further investigations should investigate its external validity and should identify predictors of learning success.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Why Interviewees Fake: The Mediating Role of Attitude in Explaining the Association Between Personality and Interview Faking</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Almost 90% of applicants engage in some form of interview faking behaviour during selection interviews to increase hiring chances (Levashina &amp; Campion, 2007). Impression management techniques are behaviours used by applicants to manipulate the interviewersâ perception of them. Impression management behaviours introduce critical issues to employee selection processes as engagement of such behaviours can deprive a more qualified candidate of the job offer. In the present study, I aimed to discover the proximal antecedents of impression management that guide the association between personality and interview faking behaviour. A sample of 45 participants completed a series of questionnaires: namely, HEXACO Personality Inventory, Attitude questionnaire, Interview Faking Behaviour Scale short. In a mediation analysis, I examined the mediating effect of attitudes toward extensive image creation on the relationship between personality characteristics of Honesty-Humility, Extraversion and Conscientiousness and interview faking behaviour. The results were biased due to several limitations such as small sample size and too homogeneous data, therefore the data were uninformative with regards to the hypotheses. Nevertheless, the current study provides extensive information of the limitations in impression management research, which future studies can utilise when designing similar studies.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Living with Chronic Pain: Investigating the psychosocial impact of Chronic Pain Conditions in adults</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Objectives: </strong>Social camouflaging is a concept first identified by the autistic community. It refers to specific behavioural patterns and strategies used by some autistic people to suppress or disguise autistic features. There is reason to believe however, that such behavioural patterns and strategies may also be present within those experiencing chronic pain.<br><strong>Design: </strong>Social stigma, mental health difficulties and condition acceptance are some of the parallels between autism and chronic pain which may prompt individuals with chronic pain to adopt coping strategies resembling autistic camouflaging. Therefore, it is hypothesised that pain disability significantly predicts camouflaging scores, while pain acceptance potentially mediates the relationship between the two. <br><strong>Methods: </strong>In this study, participants with chronic pain experience completed online questionnaires assessing their pain disability, their pain acceptance and their camouflaging scores using a newly devised camouflaging measure.<br><strong>Results: </strong>Mediation analyses showed no mediatory role of pain acceptance. However, post-hoc regression analyses revealed that both pain acceptance and pain disability are significant positive predictors of camouflaging.<br><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Although camouflaging may be motivated by negative concepts such as stigma, delegitimization and frustration, its effects may facilitate activity engagement a key feature of pain acceptance. Future research should aim in quantitatively investigating the motivators in conjunction with potential pain acceptance attitudes.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Dark Triad: An Investigation into Lying Behaviours and Motivations</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Introduction: </strong>This research was conducted to investigate whether an individualâs dark triad score predicts their tendency and motivations for lying.<br> <strong>Methods: </strong>Participants were 171 members of the general public. The Lying in Everyday Situations Scale (Hart et al., 2019) and the Short Dark Triad (Paulhus &amp; Jones, 2011; Jones &amp; Paulhus, 2013, 2014) were used. Vignettes were designed to investigate other-motivated lying and self-motivated lying.<br><strong>Results: </strong>Multiple regression analysis showed both psychopathy (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .26, p = .01) and Machiavellianism (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .56, p &lt; .001) to be significantly associated with an increase in Lying in Everyday Situations score. Narcissism had a negative association; however, this finding was insignificant (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -0.12, p = .30). Psychopathy score and Machiavellianism score are associated with an increase in the tendency to lie in everyday situations. Two separate linear regression analyses show that the Short Dark Triad score significantly predicts both other-motivated lying scores (F(1, 169) = 20.18, p &lt; .05, R2 = .10, R<sup>2</sup> Adjusted = .09) and self-motivated lying scores (F(1, 169) = 22.53, p &lt; .05, R<sup>2</sup> = .12, R<sup>2</sup> Adjusted = .11).<br> <strong>Discussion: </strong>Possible reasons for the present results are discussed alongside other factors that may impact the variance of the models.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Effects of Sex on P300 and N400 Event Related Potential Components as Candidate Markers for Alzheimerâs Disease</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The progression of Alzheimerâs Disease (AD) differs between men and women. Despite this evidence of sex effects in AD functional biomarkers and the current diagnostic criteria for AD at a preclinical level has not taken sex into consideration. Inspecting this, by EGG methods, this study used a subject sample consisting of 62 patients (30 females, 32 males) and 69 healthy elderly as controls (36 females, 33 males). To analyse, a factorial ANOVA will be performed against Group, Sex, and Memory. The main findings of the analysis indicate significant sex results in the P300 and N400 amplitudes, and further analysis of the P300 showed an interaction effect of P300 amplitude where differences were seen between patient males and females but not in the controls. This indicates that there are sex effects measured by EGG that can be applied to the clinical management of AD. As a consequence, this paper adds to the growing body of evidence that men and women should be treated differently when being diagnosed with AD.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Beauty is in the ear of the beholder: The relationship of listenersâ emotional stability to perception of novel voicesâ attractiveness</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The voice is one of the most socially salient aspects of human interaction and communication, containing many cues about an individualâs personality, such as trustworthiness, dominance and attractiveness. Vocal attractiveness can, much like physical attractiveness, have a large influence on oneâs experience of the social world. Yet, there remains little investigation on the role of the listener in these experiences, often assuming a passive role. This study sought to examine whether listener personality - as measured by the Big Five model - has an impact on listenersâ perceptions of vocal attractiveness of novel voices. Thus, 120 participants completed a personality measure and rated a selection of male and female voices. Results revealed that listenersâ emotional stability was the only trait that correlated with average attractiveness ratings, though the observed effect was rendered statistically insignificant following correctional analyses. The nuances of personal standards of attractiveness and how they relate to personality differences are discussed, and potential future research directions are briefly considered.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> An Outcome Evaluation of the NoFeart Freedom Program</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Domestic abuse can have lasting impacts on both the individual survivor and on the larger community. To address these effects, domestic abuse organizations play a vital role in helping survivors. Evaluations are often conducted to ensure these programs are achieving what they propose they do and to help them learn how to improve. The current study is an evaluation that was conducted to discern whether NoFeartâs Freedom Program is achieving its participant goals. This was executed by surveying thirty-nine women who attended the program in the past year. The first goal of the program is assessed by asking participants if they left their abuser, but the remaining goals are measured by doing paired T-tests comparing participants feelings before the program to now having completed the program. Participants in The Freedom Program at NoFeart do have increased positive feelings related to each of the goals after completing the program. Survivor wellbeing is a complicated matter and can affect many aspects of a survivorâs life as well as society (Elkin, 2019a). NoFeart conducts a promising program that have several implications for survivorsâ wellbeing and the cycle of abuse; these implications and limitations of this study are discussed within.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The effect of musicianship and musical instrumental practice on the sensory sensitivities of individuals rated high and low in autistic traits; a mixed methods approach</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research has revealed a strong link between music, the sensory system and the nervous system (Simhon et al., 2018; Penhune et al., 2007). However, not a lot of research has investigated the effect of musical expertise on sensory sensitivities, such as sensitivities experienced in ASD. To try and capture this sensory experience of musicianship, using a mixed-methods approach, I have explored the effect that musicianship and musical instrumental practice may have on the relationship between sensory sensitivity and autism. In the quantitative method, I used both musicians and non-musiciansâ to investigate the relationship between sensory sensitivity and autistic traits. I used qualitative methods, in the form of five semi-structured interviews, to explore the sensory experience of being an autistic and neurotypical musician and investigated the impact of music on their lives. Where I expect a positive correlation (Robertson &amp; Simmons, 2013), quantitative results show a weak positive to no correlative relationship between sensory sensitive score and autistic traits (r(65) = 0.066, p = 0.599). Within the musician and non-musician populations, a weak negative to no correlation was found between sensory sensitivity and autistic traits (r(43) = -0.008, p=0.955) whilst a weak positive correlation was found in the non-musician population (r(22) = 0.307, p= 0.163) . It appears here that the musician correlation was found to be negatively driving the overall correlation. Increased auditory sensitivity in musicians was also found. Qualitative results act as an explanation here for the quantitative. It reveals how beneficial music and music instrumental practice can be to wellbeing and sensory and emotional awareness, and how music combats sensory sensitivity as a therapeutic tool, especially for autistic individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Investigating visual temporal integration and expectation in individuals with various levels of Autistic traits, using sequences of natural images</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Time perception is widely known as a complex and elusive concept that requires the integration of many different cognitive processes, such as memory and attention. As a result, there are also many factors that can influence how we perceive time, how we temporally predict future events and how well we are able to temporally integrate our experiences. There has, however, been little research within the field of time perception that has attempted to use methodologies which mimic our real-life perceptions of the environment around us. Therefore, the current study uses real-world image sequences to investigate whether condition (âearlyâ or âon timeâ image frames versus âlateâ or âon timeâ image frames), scene complexity, timing of presented image frames, and levels of Autistic traits influence our perception of time, specifically with regards to prediction and temporal integration. Participants viewed image sequences depicting real-world walking routes. After these initial frames, a blank screen was then presented, and subjects were asked to imagine the walking route continuing. When a final frame was shown, they were either asked to respond whether they predicted it was âearlyâ versus âon timeâ, or âlateâ versus âon timeâ in a 2-alternative forced-choice task. A one-way between-subjects ANOVA revealed that there was a significant effect of condition on participant responses, in which participants found it easier to predict if a final image frame was âlateâ compared to if it was âearlyâ. This demonstrates that condition (âlate presentedâ versus âearly presentedâ image frames) does have an effect on participantsâ prediction and temporal integration abilities. No effect of scene complexity, timing of presented image frames or Autism Spectrum Quotient score was found, however we discuss how the current study does have limitations to consider, and that further research is required in order to parse out whether such factors can have a significant influence on prediction and temporal integration.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Costs of âFitting inâ: Camouflaging of Autistic Traits, Identity and Mental Health</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> People with autistic traits may engage in camouflaging behaviours during social interactions to better fit in to situations. Since autistic traits are continuously distributed on a spectrum, camouflaging is present in both neurotypical individuals and those with a clinical autism diagnosis. The present study uses a mixed methods approach to investigate the impact of camouflaging on mental health in the general population. 92 participants completed questionnaire measures and were asked open-ended questions about motivations and perceived consequences of camouflaging. Hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that both autistic traits and camouflaging significantly predicted social anxiety. A thematic analysis of the open-ended questions revealed the following themes: (1) Fitting in; (2) Inauthenticity and loss of identity; (3) Difficulties in relationships and (4) Costs to Mental Health. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the harmful consequences of camouflaging, which often outweigh the benefits of improved social interactions. Implications for interventions are discussed with reference to the paradoxical effects of camouflaging, as well as the link between identity and wellbeing.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Autism Knowledge and Awareness in Healthcare Students (Mixed Methods)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Objectives: </strong>Autistic people are more likely to have unfulfilled healthcare needs. One strategy suggested is to improve autism training and awareness in undergraduate healthcare professionals. This study aimed to investigate autism awareness in medicine, nursing, and dentistry students in the UK.<br></p>
<p><strong>Design: </strong>Through a convergent parallel mixed methods design, quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis were conducted simultaneously.<br></p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>One hundred and thirty-three participants completed an adapted version of the Autism Knowledge and Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, then answered open-ended questions surrounding their knowledge of autistic patients.<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Participants possessed good autism knowledge scores, with no significant difference in knowledge between degrees. However, nursing students had significantly higher self-efficacy than medical students. Only personal experience was a significant predictor of autism knowledge, however both personal and previous experience significantly predicted clinical self-efficacy. Qualitative analysis complemented these findings, elaborating on participantsâ autism knowledge and incorporating views on how autism is taught in their respective courses.<br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Healthcare students displayed good autism knowledge yet identified a need for improved autism teaching. Beyond basic inclusion, the qualitative results suggest incorporating the diverse profiles of autistic people and modifying communication skill teachings. However, the findings equally point towards the role of systemic challenges in autistic peopleâs care.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Background: </strong>Studies suggest that the average adolescent doesnât get enough sleep, particularly during the week when other commitments such as school require them to wake up early. Use of electronics at bedtime, and social media especially, has been identified as a major barrier towards adolescent sleep in a number of qualitative studies.<br><strong>Aim: </strong>To synthesise qualitative evidence of adolescent perspectives of bedtime social media.<br><strong>Design: </strong>A qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis following Thomas &amp; Hardenâs (2008) framework.<br><strong>Data sources: </strong>MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched until November 2020. Studies were subject to a strict inclusion/exclusion policy.<br><strong>Results: </strong>14 studies were included, encompassing 967 participants. Three analytical themes were developed: 1) social motivations; 2) habitual smartphone use and 3) recognition of a problem.<br><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Findings confirmed how bedtime social media use fits into a new framework for peer relations, where increased frequency and immediacy of communication lays the foundation for social accountability to meet communicative norms and a fear of missing out (FoMO). Adolescents commonly express a lack of control in relation to their social media use which triggered discussion of the addictive aspects of bedtime social media use in relation to the framework. The importance of intervention strategies to strike the right balance between high quality sleep whilst recognising the wider peer-to-peer social implications of bedtime social media use was also discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Mental Wellbeing and Youth Sport: A Qualitative Exploration through the Lens of Early Adolescent Athletes</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> With a growing emphasis on preventative action for mental health difficulties in childhood and adolescence, calls have been made to consider organised sport a protective social environment for facilitating positive mental health and wellbeing in young people. However, existing research in this area is lacking in giving young people a voice to share their own perspectives and experiences of participation in youth sport and mental wellbeing. This study aimed to explore young athletes perspectives on the potential relationship between organised sport participation and mental wellbeing. Six young athletes aged 11 to 13 participated in an online focus group discussing their perspectives of organised youth sport and mental wellbeing. Thematic analysis was applied to the data, resulting in four main themes: mental wellbeing indicators and sport, sport competition as a risk to mental wellbeing, sport as an influential social environment, and accessibility as a barrier to promoting mental wellbeing through sport. From listening to the perspectives of young athletes, this study suggests sport could be a potentially effective environment to facilitate positive mental wellbeing in young people. However, further research and amendments to practice should be carried out to maximise the benefits and minimise the risk of organised youth sport.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploring Fatigue in Care Home Workers during COVID-19</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Objectives: </strong>This study investigated whether carers working in a nursing home were more fatigued than the general population, using a consolidation of fatigue assessment scales that were also investigated for reliability. Another aim of the study was to explore whether these formal carers were at risk of developing compassion fatigue during this current coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, this was investigated using qualitative methods.<br></p>
<p><strong>Participants: </strong>Participants for the quantitative study (n=232) were from the general population (age 18-80). Participants for the qualitative study (n=5) were carers working in a care home, all of which were female (age= 20-37). <br></p>
<p><strong>Study Method: </strong>In the quantitative study we combined six fatigue questionnaires to create a 72- item questionnaire. The questionnaire took approximately 20 minutes to complete and also included several demographic questions. The qualitative study was carried out using semi- structured interviews lasting around 20 minutes.<br></p>
<p><strong>Findings: </strong>The quantitative study did not find any significant differences between carers and non-carers in reported levels of physical fatigue, sustained fatigue, sleepiness, and mental fatigue. This did not support the initial hypothesis. On the other hand, findings from the qualitative study indicated that carers were at risk of developing compassion fatigue. Five themes were identified: an inability to disengage from the caring role; personal protective equipment (PPE) as a barrier to communication; being âforgotten on the frontlineâ; a need for debrief and impact on daily life.<br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong> Overall, it appeared that although carers do not report higher levels of fatigue than the rest of the population, they may be at risk of developing compassion fatigue. To stop the adverse consequences that compassion fatigue can have on both the wellbeing of the staff and the quality of care given to residents, managements, communities, and governments need to work together to support and protect workers. Limitations and future research are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> To Shave or Not to Shave? A Qualitative Research Project Assessing Attitudes Towards Body Hair in a University Sample</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The removal of body hair is normative in Western society. Research into this area has shown consistently high proportions of samples of both men and women removing some or all of their body hair. This has led to the construction of several beauty norms, such as women being expected to be hairless. Over recent years, there have been several social changes which may have impacted how individuals view their body hair and influenced their removal practices. In this project, I used a thematic analysis to examine the responses of 12 individuals who took part in two focus groups discussing their attitudes towards body hair. Three main themes were identified: Body Hair as a Tool for Identity Construction, Body Hair as Negative and The Role of the âOtherâ. Overwhelmingly, female hairlessness and male hairiness was still conceptualised as the standard, however several positive changes were thought to have been made. The results are discussed in regard to their wider social implications, with directions for future research suggested.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Starting University During a Global Pandemic: First-year Studentsâ Experiences and Perceptions of the Impact of Emergency Remote Teaching on Student Sense of Belonging and Wellbeing during COVID-19</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research has shown that belonging is fundamental in both in-person and online learning (Peacock et al., 2020). However, previous studies are limited to students who chose to learn online. The current research aims to investigate the effect of the involuntary emergency remote teaching (ERT), which has been forced upon students by government restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acknowledging the novelty of the new academic environment, this project aimed to explore first-year studentsâ experiences of belonging and how this has been affected by the emergency response to COVID-19. Secondary to this the project sought to investigate the impact of belonging and ERT on student wellbeing. Fifteen individuals who started university in September 2020 took part in online interviews. Following transcription of the audio recordings, a reflexive thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2019) was applied to the data, identifying four overarching themes for the primary research question: social media, living in student accommodation, physically visiting campus and personality. For the secondary research question two themes were identified: mental health/wellbeing and motivation. The current findings lend support to previous literature which suggests that enhancing studentsâ sense of belonging can contribute to a healthy student life and academic success. The implications of the findings and considerations of the methodology are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Weâre All in This Together: An Exploratory Quantitative Study into Student Belonging in Sport and at University</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> As a result of COVID-19, students are facing potential social isolation and disengagement from their wider university community. Research has shown that studentsâ sense of belonging is a salient contributor to academic success and overall well-being, especially for first-year students, and that engagement in sport at university is one way through which this connection is fostered. This study aims to explore the extent to which students engage in online fitness classes, and whether this engagement is related to their sense of belonging at university. Through an online questionnaire, participants answered questions regarding their involvement in extra- and co-curricular activities and COVID-19 anxiety, and responded to a series of subscales assessing their feelings of belongingness within their university. Those who participated in sport completed an additional scale measuring their belongingness within their sporting community. Despite the constraints of the sample, correlation and multiple linear regression analyses suggested an association between perceived belonging in sport and overall belonging at university - in particular, studentsâ feelings of affiliation to their university. There was a further association between belonging in sport and engagement in co-curricular activities. Findings are discussed in relation to the limitations of the sample and the research design. Further research is proposed that replicates this study with a more representative sample size to develop these exploratory findings, with a call to identify and refine specific variables that predict greater belonging at university through sport.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Minority Stress Got You Down? Comparing the Effectiveness of Protective Factors Against Minority Stress in Sexual and Ethnic Minority Groups</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Introduction: </strong>Minority stress theory states that minority groups experience distal (external) and proximal (internal) stressors specific to their minority identification. However, the model has been criticised for not discussing resilience, while research has failed to comparatively assess stress and resilience in different minority groups. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether perceived discrimination, social support, and identity pride (three commonly investigated protective factors against stress) are equally effective in protecting against minority stress in ethnic and sexual minority groups. <br></p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>52 ethnic minority participants and 55 sexual minority participants completed an adapted version of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (AMEIM), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Perceived Discrimination Scale (PDS), and the International Positive Affect, Negative Affect Scale - Short Form (I-PANAS-SF). Six simple linear regression models were produced assessing the significance of each factor as a predictor of emotional affect in each regression, and three were calculated to identify the interaction effect between predictor and minority condition to calculate the difference in effectiveness of each factor in each condition. <br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Perceived discrimination was a significant negative predictor of emotional affect in each condition (F(1, 50) = 21.45, p&lt;.000, and an R<sup>2</sup> of .300 for the ethnic minority condition and F(1, 53) = 7.96, p&lt;.05, and an R<sup>2</sup> of .131 for the sexual minority condition) as were the results for identity pride (F(1, 50) = 8.472, p&lt;.01, and an R<sup>2</sup> of .145 for the ethnic minority condition and F(1, 53) = 16.13, p&lt;.001, and an R<sup>2</sup> of .233 for the sexual minority condition). Social support was only significant for the sexual minority condition (F(1, 50) = 3.094, p =.085, and an R<sup>2</sup> of .059 for the ethnic minority condition and F(1, 53) = 12.41, p &lt;.001, and an R<sup>2</sup> of .190 for the sexual minority condition). The interaction effects for each predictor were non-significant (Perceived discrimination was -9.705 (p=.307), social support was -8.278 (p=.246), and identity pride was -8.115 (p=.231)).<br></p>
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>Consistent with previous research, each protective factor was a significant predictor of emotional affect, excluding social support in the ethnic minority condition. However, no interaction effect was significant, resulting in the acceptance of the second null hypothesis. These findings suggest that the minority stress model can be applied to resilience against minority stress, resulting in greater practical application of theory to therapeutic and social practice. Similar research taking an intersectional approach would benefit current understandings of minority stress as well as more comparative literature to determine the validity of the interaction effects obtained in this study. <br></p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Sunny Side Up: Exploring Sex as a Mediator in the Relationship between Depressive Symptoms &amp; Interpretation Bias (in a Scrambled Sentence Task)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> A growing body of research has established a relationship between severity of depressive symptoms and the interpretation of ambiguous scenarios, images and sentences. What is less well researched are the factors that may mediate this relationship. The current study aimed to assess the role of biological sex on the relationship between depressive symptoms and interpretation bias in an ambiguous sentence task. One hundred and forty-seven participants completed online measures assessing depressive symptoms and interpretation bias. A moderate positive correlation (r = .59) was found between depressive symptoms and interpretation bias in the current sample, and a multiple linear regression model revealed that sex did not have a significant mediating role in this relationship. It may therefore be concluded that, in the current sample, sex did not play a significant mediating role in the relationship between depressive symptoms and negative interpretations. Principally, the findings from the current study indicate that further research is required to identify the key variables that may mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and interpretation bias. Specific limitations and contributions of the current study to the overall field of research are also discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The effects of exercise levels and sleep quality on the perceived resilience of young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research has shown that young adultsâ mental wellbeing has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to date, little analysis has been conducted to investigate preventative factors. There is already extensive research evidence of the positive effects of sleep and exercise on mental and physical benefits wellbeing. These include psychological resilience, which is vital in the current climate. This study investigated the effects of sleep quality and exercise levels on the perceived resilience of 92 young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A quantitative approach was used, and participants completed an online survey detailing their sleep and exercise habits before and during the initial UK lockdown of March- July 2020. All participants were aged 18-24 years and were required to have lived in the UK during the initial lockdown. The results indicated that sleep quality and exercise levels before lockdown predicted participantsâ perceived resilience during lockdown. Sleep quality during lockdown was also a predictor of perceived resilience at that time, whereas exercise during lockdown was not. These findings can be used to inform and educate both professionals and young people about the importance of establishing and maintaining adequate sleep quality and exercise levels, and the benefits that this can have on their future psychological resilience.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The perinatal period is a time when women are at greater risk of developing a mental illness, which has serious effects on both the motherâs health and babyâs development. Through screening questions, and providing care during pregnancy and the antenatal period, midwives are important sources of knowledge and support for women at risk of developing perinatal mental illness. However, qualified midwives have reported a lack of confidence and knowledge relating to perinatal mental health, and student midwives lack the appropriate focus on the topic during their training. Through a survey design, this study aimed to understand Scottish final-year midwifery studentsâ knowledge and confidence relating to perinatal mental health. The results suggest further education and new training methods dedicated to the topic are necessary in universities and greater support for students is needed when on placement.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Perception of Autistic Behaviours in Relation to Knowledge of Autism</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Although attitudes towards autism have improved in recent years, non-autistic people often still hold negative views of autistic people. Consequently, autistic individuals are stigmatised and discriminated against. This contributes to self-stigma amongst autistic people as well as a host of personal, educational, and professional challenges. Previous findings indicated heightened stigma levels towards disruptive autistic behaviours; a claim corroborated by autistic people themselves. Yet, there is little understanding of contributing factors to stigmatisation of autistic behaviours. In particular, the role of knowledge of autism is still debated. It is unclear whether higher knowledge of the condition is directly linked to lower stigma, or if both knowledge and stigma are strongly linked to exposure as a third variable. This study aimed to examine whether participants expressed higher levels of stigma towards autistic behaviours with repetitive motor movement compared to autistic behaviours without repetitive motor movement. Secondly, we aimed to examine if higher knowledge was related to lower levels of stigma. We gathered data from 99 participants, presenting them with three vignettes - displaying autistic behaviours without stimming, autistic behaviours with stimming and a control - immediately followed by a short social distance scale and, finally the ASKSG (McClain et al., 2019) to assess knowledge. Results indicated that self-reported stigma was significantly higher for both autistic conditions compared to a control but no significant difference in explicit stigma was found between them. There was no significant relationship between knowledge and expressed stigma. Consequently, there is still a need to address stigmatisation of autistic behaviours. However, the most common interventions aiming to decrease stigma towards autism rely on increasing knowledge. These findings suggest that knowledge has little bearing on stigma levels; so, interventions based on increasing knowledge may not be the most effective.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING THE CULTURAL IDEOLOGIES, CONSTRAINTS AND BELIEFS SURROUNDING THE CONCEPT OF FATIGUE</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> This study investigated the prevalence and dimensionality of fatigue in different cultural populations through the development of a new fatigue questionnaire comprising of multiple fatigue scale. Through incorporating qualitative means, this study also aimed to assess the experience and ideologies supporting fatigue in European and Caribbean cultures. The quantitative element of this study combined 6 questionnaires to form a 72-item battery to assess the general population. The qualitative study implemented a semi-structured interview lasting roughly 45 minutes to capture the personal experience of a diverse group of people from Caribbean and European cultural backgrounds. Results from the quantitative study revealed no significant differences between the cultural subgroups, Europe and Americas, however the qualitative analysis highlighted that fatigue was a culture specific symptom, whereby culture affected in representation and interpretation. Through thematic analysis, three themes were identified: Dimensionality of Fatigue, Contextual experience of fatigue and Cultural ideologies. These findings should inform interventions and future studies to revise the generalisability of fatigue constructs and definition to adopt a culture outlook on health symptomologies, specifically fatigue.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> âYou up? ðâ: An Investigation of the Facilitative Influence of Emoji in Text-based Communication</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Emoji are a nuanced and communicative tool that serve to enrich text-based interactions by substituting non-verbal behaviours. The purpose of this study is to investigate how emojis are used and interpreted in digitally-mediated conversation, and whether people with autistic or social anxiety traits might use and interpret them differently. Adopting a within-subject design, this study presented participants with text message-emoji pairings under various congruency conditions in which they were asked to rate the text message on its believability and perceived mood, with an additional measurement of response time. Appropriate questionnaires indicated participants with high autistic and social anxiety traits. The results showed support for the preliminary hypotheses as there was increased ambiguity in response to the believability and perceived mood of the incongruent emoji-text and longer response times, compared to the congruent pairings. However, participants with autistic and social anxiety traits were not found to show significant differences in response time, perception of mood and believability. By exploring differences in emoji usage and how they facilitate text-message interactions, there is potential to understand how emoji may benefit individuals in a clinical setting and further cultivate meaningful experience in text-based communication.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Investigating the Speed and Accuracy Effect During Decision-Making and the Role of Confidence</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> In a wide range of situations, decision-makers need to negotiate between the competing demands of response speed and response accuracy. This dilemma is known as the speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT). The current studyâs focus was to replicate SAT effects. Based on existing literature on SAT, two hypotheses were drawn. The first one predicted that subjects would be faster in Speed conditions as well as faster for higher levels of evidence. The second hypothesis predicted that participants will be more accurate in the Accuracy instructions, in addition to higher levels of coherency. When external feedback is absent, perceptual decisions are accompanied by feelings of confidence that reflect the likelihood of the decision being correct. This study further investigated mean confidence differences between Speed and Accuracy instructions, outlining two more hypotheses. Mean confidence ratings from Speed instruction were expected to be lower than that of the Accuracy, yet with greater variability. These predictions were based on literature investigating metacognitive evaluations, considering pre- and post- decisional processes. To compute analyses, secondary data from 19 participants from an unpublished study was used. Results using a 2x3 ANOVA for the replication of SAT were significant, as subjects were quicker under Speed rather than Accuracy condition, and more accurate in Accuracy rather than Speed condition. Findings from confidence judgements unravelled a series of insignificant outcomes. To comprehend confidence ratings from Speed and Accuracy conditions, shift function was applied. Despite results of shift function being insignificant, interesting trends are identified and further discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> An Exploratory Study on the Effectiveness of Nudging on Prosocial Behaviour in an Era of Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Conspiracy theories have been spreading relentlessly throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Research has shown how conspiracy beliefs can reduce a number of prosocial and health behaviours whilst also increasing prejudicial attitudes and violent intentions from only a single exposure. Nudging, the psychologically based intervention strategy, offers a potential opportunity to attend to growing concerns regarding conspiracies. This study experimentally investigated the effect of an intervention nudge supporting or debunking the popular 5G conspiracy in the UK on predicted prosocial behaviour. Further regression analysis investigated the associations between prosocial behaviour predictions and vaccination intentions with various predictor variables. 102 participants from a mixed sample of students and the general public were randomly assigned into two groups and completed a questionnaire which included measures of psychopathy, conspiracy mentality, past and predicted prosocial behaviour and vaccination intentions. Results indicated no significant difference in prosocial forecasting between the two groups. However, from the predictive models it could be suggested that there may be an anti-conspiracy effect related to the exposure of a conspiracy support extract. The implications of these results are discussed relative to the context of the unique fact-checking and scrutinising environments in the UK and worldwide throughout the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of nudging in the efforts to reduce the negative consequences of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> A âdark stormy fairytaleâ: Exploring the Lived Experiences of Migrant Womxn in Glasgow with No Recourse to Public Funds</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research has found that post-migration stressors largely contribute to poor mental health outcomes in people seeking asylum (Solberg et al., 2020). In particular, policies such as no right to work and No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) push already vulnerable populations further into precarity (Dudhia, 2020). This has a distinct effect on migrant womxn with NRPF who are at increased risk of facing disbelief, destitution, detention and deportation (McIlwaine et al., 2019). This study used collage-making to explore the impact of the NRPF policy on the mental health of womxn seeking asylum in Glasgow. Carrying out a thematic analysis, three themes were determined; âMy inner self is brokenâ, âWaiting just killsâ and âDark stormy fairytaleâ. The findings of this study highlight how the asylum process infringes upon peopleâs identities, their sense of control over the future as well as belongingness to Scotland. Social support emerged as a critical tool to tackle some of the mental health concerns that prevail as a direct result of the post-migration environment (Salway et al., 2020).</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Individual differences in change in recreational physical activity levels for young adults during Covid-19 lockdown: An investigation into personality, exercise motivation, exercise behavioural regulation and length of participation in primary mode of physical activity</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Covid-19 lockdown is a novel factor influencing physical activity levels. Physical activity levels and exercise adherence have previously been consistently positively associated with intrinsic exercise motivation, intrinsic exercise behavioural regulation, and the personality dimensions of extraversion and conscientiousness, but consistently negatively associated with neuroticism. Length of participation in primary mode of physical activity shows a possible bidirectional relationship with intrinsic exercise motivation and regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether individual differences in personality, exercise motivation, exercise behavioural regulation, and length of participation in primary mode of physical activity are reliable predictors of physical activity levels both pre and during Covid-19 lockdown for young adults aged 18-30 years old (N = 85). Recreational physical activity levels were measured by two modified versions of the Recreational Subscale of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Personality was measured by the Big Five Inventory, exercise motivation by the Exercise Motivations Inventory-2, exercise behavioural regulation by the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3, and length of participation in primary mode of physical activity pre Covid-19 lockdown by single questions. Retrospective self-report of recreational physical activity levels revealed a heterogenous change in physical activity levels during Covid-19 lockdown (47.06% decreased, 3.56% did not change, 49.41% increased). Linear mixed effects multiple regression models revealed that Covid-19 lockdown did not significantly influence the relationships between recreational physical activity levels and any individual difference measure. The predictions for a significant positive association between recreational physical activity levels and extraversion and conscientiousness were not supported. The prediction for a significant negative association between recreational physical activity and neuroticism was also not supported. However, there was a significant positive association between recreational physical activity levels and agreeableness (df = 85, t = 2.665, p &lt;.01). The predictions were supported for a significant positive association between recreational physical activity levels and length of participation in primary mode of physical activity (df = 85, t = 4.326, p &lt;.001), intrinsic exercise motivation (df = 85, t = 2.232, p &lt;.05), and intrinsic exercise behavioural regulation (df = 85, t = 2.515, p &lt;.05). Calculation of effect size parameters revealed medium effect sizes for agreeableness (0.43), intrinsic regulation (0.42), and intrinsic motivation (0.33), and a weak effect size for length of participation (0.01) on recreational physical activity levels. These findings add to the literature on the reliability of intrinsic exercise motivation and intrinsic exercise behavioural regulation as consistent predictors of physical activity, and to the novel literature on factors affecting physical activity during Covid-19 lockdown.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Anxious Academics: The Relationships between Anxiety, Memory and Attention in UK University Students</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>The relationship between anxiety and cognition is a complex one but it is widely accepted that anxiety results in a deficit in cognitive functioning. However, this assumption is based upon experiments which use cognitive tasks lacking ecological validity and utilise participation from the adult population who may be subjected to normal age-related cognitive decline. An empirical evaluation into the effects of anxiety on the cognitive functioning of students, who are mostly not subject to normal age-related cognitive decline but are a population with extremely high levels of anxiety, has not been conducted. This study aimed to address this gap by investigating the effects of anxiety on memory and attention in students. It was hypothesized that higher anxiety scores would correlate with and predict poorer cognitive functioning.<br></p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPANTS: </strong>141 participants completed the study. Participants were all students at UK universities, whose first language was English. Participants with the diversities of colour blindness and dyslexia were asked not to participate in this research.<br></p>
<p><strong>STUDY METHOD: </strong>A correlational design was used. An online version of the DASS-42 was used to obtain each participantâs anxiety score, the outcome measure for the anxiety variable. Following completion of this, participants attended a virtual session where they completed the Stroop task to measure attention performance and a picture and word association task to measure memory performance. An interference (IG) score was calculated for the Stroop task and the time taken to complete the picture and word association task was recorded. IG score and time were the outcome measures for the cognitive variables.<br></p>
<p><strong>FINDINGS: </strong>Anxiety had a significant negative correlation with performance on the memory task (r = 0.68, df = 139, p &lt; 0.01) and was a significant predictor of time taken to complete it (F(1, 139) = 118.7, p = 2.2x10-16, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.4607, R<sup>2</sup>-adjusted = 0.4568). However, anxiety did not significantly correlate with or predict performance on the attention task. The results provided partial support for the hypothesis. <br></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These results suggested that students may face significant deficits in cognitions, particularly in the memory domain. This likely affects their academic performance. During the pandemic, anxiety levels are higher and thus it should be recommended that universities provide support for all students undertaking assessments. Future research should investigate how the cognitive deficits students with high levels of anxiety face could be managed and how effective such strategies are.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> An Investigation into Group Identification, Subjective Wellbeing, and Autistic Traits</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Group identification can be defined as a subjective sense of belonging to oneâs social group, coupled with a subjective sense of commonality with group members. Group identification plays an important role in protecting and increasing wellbeing. Social and communicative challenges experienced by individuals with higher autistic traits can impact their ability to identify with groups and the absence of such connections can have negative impacts on subjective wellbeing. This study investigated the relationship between group identification, autistic traits, and subjective wellbeing. It was hypothesised that both total group identification and autistic traits would predict depression and also that both total group identification and autistic traits would predict satisfaction with life. 135 (112 females, 23 males) participants from the general population completed measures in group identification, autistic traits, depression, and satisfaction with life, as well as control variables (age and gender). Results from two hierarchical regressions revealed that both hypotheses were supported as both total group identification and autistic traits were found to significantly predict satisfaction with life and depression. Discussions include the implications of group identification in promoting positive subjective wellbeing outcomes, including applications for group based interventions that promote and encourage group identification. Limitations and considerations including potential impacts of COVID-19 on the study are also discussed with reference to uncertainty and isolation as a result of lockdown and other restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Evolution of Data Sharing Practices in the Psychological Literature</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Sharing data has many benefits. However, data sharing rates remain low, for the most part well below 50%. A variety of interventions encouraging data sharing have been proposed. We focus here on editorial policies. Kidwell et al.Â (2016) assessed the impact of the introduction of badges in Psychological Science; Hardwicke et al.Â (2018) assessed the impact of Cognitionâs mandatory data sharing policy. Both studies found policies to improve data sharing practices, but only assessed the impact of the policy for up to 25 months after its implementation. We aimed to examine the effect of these policies over a longer term by reusing their data and collecting a follow-up sample including articles published up until December 31 st , 2019. We fit generalized additive models as these allow for a more flexible assessment of the effect of time, which allows the identification of non-linear changes in the trend. These models were compared to generalized linear models to examine whether the non-linearity is needed. In journals that implemented a policy, data sharing statement rates increased over time and there was a level change in reusability. There was variability in the levels of increase, so we suggest future research should examine a larger number of policies to draw conclusions about their efficacy. We also encourage future research to investigate the barriers to data sharing specific to psychology subfields in order to identify the best interventions to tackle them.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Age and Gender Differences in Traditional Masculine Ideology and Help-Seeking Attitudes</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Literature has identified a reluctancy amongst men to engage in psychological services, possibly as a result of conformity to traditional masculine norms. Furthermore, more negative attitudes towards help-seeking have been acknowledged in younger adults. The current study investigated the relationship between masculinity and help-seeking attitudes; and explored age and gender as factors which could influence these attitudes. The questionnaires administered were the Male Role Norms Inventory-Short Form (MRNI-SF) and the Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMHS). One hundred and forty-five participants (102 female; 42 male; 1 nonbinary) were recruited. Older adults (41-65 years old) elicited higher scores on the IASMHS than younger adults (18-40 years old), therefore, younger people demonstrated more negative attitudes towards help-seeking. Men scored higher on the MRNI-SF, indicating stronger conformity to masculine norms. Moreover, women yielded higher scores on the IASMHS than men, establishing that females hold more positive attitudes towards help-seeking. Negative correlations were found between IASMHS and MRNI-SF scores for both men and women. Thus, showing that higher masculinity results in more negative attitudes in both genders. A regression analysis indicated that MRNI-SF scores predicted IASMHS scores. The results of this study provide additional research to suggest that traditional masculine ideology acts as a significant obstacle for help-seeking. This has important implications for future clinical practice concerning mental health.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> A qualitative thematic analysis of students lived experiences of sleep and the effect of video game playing and social media usage on curtailed sleep</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Current literature posits that popularity for electronic entertainment devices (EEDs) for example social media sites (SM) and video games (VGs) especially for young adults in Western Societies are rapidly growing (Clement et al, 2019 &amp; Peracchia &amp; Curcio, 2018). With an estimated 2.65 billion active SMS users worldwide and with 89% of adolescents admitting to having at least one form of media appliance in their sleep environment, EED usage is now ubiquitous amongst young adults (Anderson &amp; Jiang, 2018 &amp; Gradisar &amp; Czeisler, 2013). Current literature has influenced attitudes that are heavily averse to SM and VGs with a large volume of evidence suggesting that EEDâs for leisure and communication (VGs &amp; SMS) negatively impact sleep quality, duration, hygiene and health and wellbeing (Carter et al, 2016, Woods &amp; Scott, 2016 &amp; Rehbein et al 2010). Whilst there has been a wide amount of quantitative literature exploring the positivist cause and effect relationship of EEDs on curtailed sleep my research has revealed some alarming gaps in the literature. There is little research addressing emerging young adults/adolescents lived experience regarding SM and VG in a qualitative setting. Therefore, this paper ran an inductive reflexive thematic analysis utilising focus group interviews on (N=20) students aged 18-25 to explore their adolescent lived experiences of nocturnal EED usage. The aim was understanding student lived experience of sleep and the impact of playing VGs and using SM on curtailed sleep. Our analysis produced five overarching themes: âFear of Missing Outâ, âGenerational Differencesâ, âGender Differencesâ, âVGs Dictate Bedtime but SM Dictates Sleepâ and âBarriers to Sleepâ. This analysis offers valuable insight into the student lived experience of curtailed sleep as regards SM and VGs and offers insights into conclusions and future research withstanding its own limitations.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The role of perceived social isolation and online social support on sleep quality of students during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Introduction: </strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many lifestyle changes, including a huge reduction in in-person social contact. This presents a potential increase of social isolation in university students, yet research suggests social support may reduce the perception and effects of social isolation. Increased perceived social isolation has been correlated with poor sleep quality, which is an issue within the student population. This study examines the extent to which perceived social isolation and online social support predict university studentsâ sleep quality throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.<br></p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Currently enrolled university students aged 18-23 years (N = 121) completed online questionnaires, measuring sleep quality, perceived social isolation, perceived online social support and satisfaction with social interactions.<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>The results showed that poor sleep quality was a prevalent issue among the student sample, with 45% of them falling within the category for âprobable insomniaâ (Espie et al., 2014). Perceived social isolation was also prevalent within the sample. Lower levels of perceived social isolation were significantly associated with better sleep quality. Regression analyses also revealed perceived social isolation and online social support as significant predictors of studentsâ sleep. Participants living in student accommodation showed greatest levels of online social support, and least social isolation. No gender differences were found.<br></p>
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>Findings were consistent with previous research. The study has contributed to research underpinning the relationship between social isolation and sleep quality, specifically in students. Efforts to develop intervention strategies, focused on providing effective and available online social support for university students will benefit clinical services, by aiming to reduce the issue of poor sleep quality in students. Future research should consider addressing the limitations of the present study by using more objective sleep measures, controlling for individual differences, and measuring received social support as well as perceived.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> While brief mindfulness has been shown effective in various domains of health and wellbeing, these findings are mainly based on quantitative research. In the present qualitative study, we explored how university students without previous meditating experience learn and apply brief mindfulness to the anxiety-provoking aspects of COVID-19. To describe and make sense of participantsâ experience of mindfulness, we used an exploratory case study design. We recruited 16 undergraduate students from the University of Glasgow. In four focus groups, participants first identified an anxiety-provoking aspect of COVID-19. Secondly, they discussed their experience of writing and thinking about this aspect. Next, participants listened to a five-minute recording of mindfulness. Finally, they applied the instructions to their aspect for two minutes and then discussed their experiences. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. Our results suggest that participants perceived the brief mindfulness-based instructions as clear and easy to learn. Importantly, visual metaphor played a key role in understanding the essence of decentering. As a result of applying the instructions, participants were able to experience the anxiety-provoking aspects in a transient way. Furthermore, they reported feeling more detached from their anxiety-provoking aspects, and less overwhelmed by them. In the future, participants would use brief mindfulness in specific short-term situations across domains. Brief decentering-based instructions may be a potential tool that is accessible and effective to help university undergraduate students with the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Individual Differences in the Uncanny Valley Effect: Broader Autism Phenotype Effects</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The uncanny valley effect (UVE) refers to the non-linear relationship between the human-likeness of an artificial agent and the perceiverâs affinity towards that agent, with highly (yet not perfectly) realistic agents tending to elicit strong negative affect. This research provides a comprehensive rationale for a relationship between autism and the individual differences in the UVE with a focus on conceptualising autism as being a continuous dimension. It then extends prior research by presenting an empirical study that directly measures this relationship in a non- clinical, adult sample. A within-subjects online experiment involved 73 participants who reported their likeability and eeriness responses to faces ranging on the human-likeness dimension (HLD) and completed the broader autism phenotype questionnaire (BAP-Q). A mixed-effects polynomial approach was adopted to continuously capture the effect of the BAPQ on the UVE. Although all participants displayed responses characteristic of the UVE, analyses revealed distinct BAP-Q subscale effects: an interacting effect of the aloof subscale and HLD on likeability for the first polynomial term (p &lt; 0.005) and main negative effects of BAP-Q total, pragmatic language and rigid scores on eeriness (p &lt; 0.05). Limited by low internal consistency of the BAP-Q subscales, the results provide tentative evidence for the distinct mechanisms of action of BAP sub-domains on the positive and negative emotions associated with the UVE. Implications, along with the limitations are discussed, in light of the promising individual differences approach to the UVE for our understanding human-robot interaction in the context of autism therapy and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Effectiveness of an online intervention to improve resilience in undergraduate students</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Introduction: </strong>The rates of mental health issues that undergraduate students experience and the demand placed on university counseling services have been steadily increasing. Thus, there is a need to create interventions that help students manage their mental health needs and increase resilience without putting more pressure on counseling services. The aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of a short, online resilience intervention on undergraduate students in a randomized control trial.<br></p>
<p><strong>Method: </strong>Participants were 15 undergraduate students at various Scottish universities. The online intervention in this study was created using research-based positive psychology and mindfulness activities. The participants completed the Connor-Davidson Risk and Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 25; Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003) immediately before and after completing their respective control or intervention activities. It was hypothesized that there would be a significantly greater increase in resilience levels of students who complete the resilience intervention when compared to the control group<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Results of an ANCOVA showed that the intervention did not significantly increase participant post-test resilience scores. <br></p>
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>The implications of the results are discussed. Possible explanations of these results include the Covid-19 pandemic, the impact of culture on resilience levels, and potential disinterest regarding the intervention. While the results in this study were not significant, they provide a base for further research into effective online resilience interventions for undergraduates.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Prevalence and Exacerbating Factors of Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours in the LGBTQ+ Community</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Even though LGBTQ+ individuals are at high risk of experiencing mental health issues, no research has investigated the associations between LGBTQ+ identity and body-focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs). This study aimed to explore this possible link by looking at the prevalence of BFRB symptomology in the LGBTQ+ community and exacerbating factors. This study employed a between-subjects design to compare differences between participants who self-reported BFRB symptomology and those who did not. LGBTQ+ participants were recruited via convenience sampling to complete an online survey. Prevalence rates of BFRB symptomology were found to be higher in the LGBTQ+ sample in comparison to literature on the heteronormative/cisgender population. Out of the total sample (N = 753), 234 (31.1%) participants self-reported BFRB symptomology. Of those, 95 (12.6%) reported hair pulling, and 177 (23.5%) skin picking. Through multiple t-tests, participants with BFRB symptomology reported greater levels of negative emotional states, LGBTQ+ stigma and discrimination, family rejection, and intersectional stigma for BFRBs and mental health issues. Transgender individuals with BFRB symptomology also reported higher levels of dysmorphic appearance concern. No significant differences were found on LGBTQ+ outness. A further exploratory analysis revealed some differences between BRFB conditions. Results suggest that LGBTQ+ individuals face unique factors that may exacerbate BFRB symptomology. These findings could enhance treatments of BFRBs in the LGBTQ+ community. It is anticipated that the current study will stimulate further investigation of this important area.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Role of Perceptual Choice Confidence in the Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The speed-accuracy tradeoff characterises a fundamental property of decision making where more accurate decisions typically require a longer time, whereas fast decisions tend to be error-prone. Furthermore, each decision is associated with a subjectively perceived degree of uncertainty. Choice confidence constitutes a metacognitive ability to reflect on a committed decision and estimate its accuracy. Nonetheless, the role of decision confidence within the speed-accuracy tradeoff is largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate this question by analysing a previously unexplored secondary dataset whereby subjects performed perceptual decisions about a direction of moving dot kinematograms and subsequently rated their confidence about the choice. Firstly, in this work, the speed-accuracy tradeoff was successfully replicated. Secondly, non-parametric tests revealed a greater distributional spread of confidence ratings when subjects were instructed to prioritise decision speed, compared to accuracy-emphasis instructions. The results were discussed in relation to the neural mechanism of choice confidence. Moreover, enhanced distributional differences of confidence ratings were found across lower deciles (accuracy-emphasis instructions &gt; speed-emphasis instructions), although statistically non-significant. Thirdly, intertrial sequential effects of confidence ratings onto response times showed that higher choice confidence (trial n) translated to slower decision speed (trial n+1). These findings were contextualised within neuroscientific research and computational approaches to decision-making processes.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Racial and Ethnic differences between South Asians and Caucasians in Seeking Mental Health Treatment in Scotland with respect to Stigma during COVID-19</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> People who suffer from mental illnesses are often stigmatized by society, and this stigma discourages them from seeking psychological treatment or any treatment at all (Corrigan &amp; Watson, 2002). Individuals from ethnic minority communities are often subjected to double stigmatisation (Faye, 2005). This is due to bigotry and stigmatisation stemming from their race, as well as stigmatisation stemming from their mental illness. Additionally, Individuals from ethnic minority groups often experience problems within their own societies as a result of traditional and cultural views (Arday, 2018). Where mental ill-health is stigmatised and considered a taboo. This study investigates the racial and ethnic differences between Caucasianâs and South Asianâs in seeking mental health treatment in Scotland with respect to stigma during COVID-19. In this study participants of both Caucasian (n=32) and South Asian (n=36) ethnicities were gathered from the student pool of the University of Glasgow and surrounding areas. Individuals were provided with online self-report questionnaires and were asked to answer multiple questions. The data obtained was then analysed through an online R server, where means and standard deviations, two-way Anova tests and Welch two sample t-tests were carried out to examine statistical differences. The results obtained showed that there was in fact differences present between the two ethnicities. South Asians participants reported back a greater level of negative attitude towards help-seeking behaviour for mental ill- health. Inconsistent with our prediction there were no differences found within the ethnic groups when comparing responses to help-seeking of individuals of different ethnicities. The results also showed that again inconsistent with our prediction Caucasians portrayed a greater level of internalised stigma that South Asians. Overall, although there were differences present between the two ethnic groups, some differences were not as predicted.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploring the student well-being of adolescent girls with Prader-Willi syndrome: a qualitative study</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> High prevalence rates of mental health difficulties are reported in young people with learning disabilities (Learning disability statistics: mental health problems, 2020). As the well-being of children and adolescents is context dependent, schools have become a key setting when researching their student well-being (Tobia et al., 2019). Notably, adolescent girls with a disability have reported particularly low levels of well-being at school (Arciuli &amp; Emerson, 2020). Although there is comprehensive guidance for supporting the student well-being of people with common learning disabilities, this is not inclusive of rarer conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). To fill this gap, this study aimed to explore the student well-being of adolescent girls with PWS by twinning a school day storyboard task with an informal interview, whereby participants were encouraged to share their experiences of daily school life. A thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) was carried out which established three themes: (1) a sense of belonging; (2) feeling comfortable and safe in the school environment; and (3) a desire to learn and be challenged. The findings highlighted the preferences and values of participants, as well as the crucial role members of staff play in enabling secure identity development and effective school functioning. Future research may wish to include a more diverse sample and explore the effectiveness of behavioural management interventions for PWS within schools.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Depression is Related to Religiosity but not the Perception of Emotion in Voices</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Studies have suggested being religious is associated with fewer incidences of depression. Coupling this finding with the theoretical risk factor of socioemotional interpretation biases in the disorderâs onset, we hypothesised that (i) there would be a negative monotonic relationship between self-reported religiosity and depression and that (ii) the combination of religiosity measures with participantsâ interpretation of emotion in voices would significantly predict depression scores over and above participantsâ levels of religiosity alone. A total of 739 participants completed the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales, the Duke University Religion Index, and categorised the perceived emotion of 140 synthetic voices as happy or sad. Although religiosity had a significant main effect on depression, <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>(12) = 61.40, p &lt; .001, the relationship was not consistently negative across all levels of self-reported religiosity. Hierarchical ordinal regression models revealed the interpretation of socioemotional vocal expressions did not contribute significantly to the religiosity-only models for male voices, <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>(1) = .23, p = .64, or female voices, <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>(1) = .003, p = .96. These findings together suggest the theoretical importance of negative interpretation biases in depression may be mitigated by broader belief systems, such as religion, which influence how we perceive our socioemotional world.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Studentsâ Personal Social Networks and Mental Health During the First Year at University: An Egocentric Network Analysis</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Mental health difficulties in the transition to university may be further exacerbated by changes occurring in new undergraduate studentsâ social network. A wealth of research indeed demonstrates the link between social ties and social support and first year studentsâ mental health trajectories in the context of the university transition (Pittman &amp; Richmond, 2009; Rubin et al., 2016). A novel methodology from Social Network Theory and Analysis (SNT/A) has emerged in recent years as an effective approach to investigating social environments through systematically assessing individualsâ social connections and characterising their personal social networks in terms of structure, function and composition, thus offering interesting avenues to investigating the link between social ties and mental health (Valente &amp; Pitts, 2017). In the UK, since March 2020 and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, important restrictions have been placed on social mixing and have led universities across the countries to implement a shift to online, remote, teaching, leaving new undergraduate students especially with reduced opportunities for in-person socialising and on-campus activity, the implications of which, remain largely unknown. Understanding the effects on this cohortâs mental health, social networks and their interrelationship thus appears to be of crucial importance. This online survey study is an exploratory approach aimed to investigate first-year studentsâ mental health, using a variety of outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and insomnia), their personal social networks using an egocentric network (EgoNet) approach from SNT/A and their associations as well as incorporating a qualitative component to enrich and corroborate interpretations from quantitative analyses. 61 participants (M = 19.1, SD = 3.1) were recruited from the 2020 cohort of the University of Glasgow. Results demonstrated high levels of psychological distress amongst the student in this study. Ego network analyses as well as qualitative accounts also pointed to important disruptions to the normal processes of change in social networks in the transition to university, particularly with regards to studentsâ social integration within the university environment. Associations emerged between various characteristics of studentsâ personal social networks and mental health outcomes across the entire sample and when living situations were considered. This study makes a contribution to the body of literature examining student mental health during the transition to university through examining its social and interpersonal context. Implications of these findings for informing potential approaches to supporting the specific cohort of 2020 and mitigating negative outcomes in the continuation of their studies are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploring the experience of people transitioning toward reducing meat and dairy consumption</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Meat and dairy production are among the greatest contributors to climate change. Dietary transition toward a plant-based diet might reduce environmental impact and improve the sustainability of the food industry. Although an increasing number of people in Western countries are willing to reduce meat and/or dairy consumption, further understanding of the factors influencing transition is needed. In this study we explore the process of meat and dairy reduction and transition toward a plant-based diet in a sample of Italian population. Furthermore, this study explores the role of self-control, habits, identity and social norms within this process. Thirty non-vegan Italian participants reducing meat and/or dairy for sustainability reasons completed an online qualitative survey. Three themes arouse from thematic analysis, namely conflicting motivations, the social environment and the food environment and strategies. Participants might employ self-control when they experience a conflict between incompatible drives, and in the process of new habits formation. Conviviality and lack of control over food provision might exacerbate the role of social support and social norms in dietary choice. Finally, being Italian might involve strongly rooted food traditions, which are at times incompatible with the elimination of meat and/or dairy. For this reason, participant might need to flexibly accept limited lapses allowing them to balance sustainability with traditional values.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Pivot to Online Teaching and Widening Participation in UK Higher Education</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Sudden pivot to online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic forced higher education teaching staff to adapt quickly. In the UK, widening participation is a central concept in higher education. Previous research suggested that online teaching can support widening participation. We surveyed UK higher education teaching staff (N = 55) to explore the impact of the pivot to online teaching on widening participation issues of accessibility and equity. Online qualitative surveys were conducted to explore what challenges and opportunities for widening participation were experienced. Employing thematic analysis, five major themes were identified: digital poverty, unsuitable environments, accessibility, student engagement, and workload. Future implications for improving widening participation and online teaching are discussed. We conclude that online teaching can support accessibility and equity of higher education, however, challenges and inequalities to widening participation are persistent in an online environment.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Spray it and Say it: A Study on Youth-Led Programmes and Mental Well-Being</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Poverty, deprivation and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have all been strongly linked to a higher incidence of substance misuse, joining gangs, engaging in antisocial behaviours and experiencing poor mental well-being in young people. An initiative recognized by recent research as having the potential to be a factor mitigating the detrimental effects of poverty and deprivation on a young personâs life outcomes and trajectory is youth-led programmes. One such programme is the G20 Project based in Maryhill, one of the most deprived areas of Glasgow. Accordingly, this research aimed to explore Scottish young peopleâs perception of the impact that the G20 youth project has on their mental well-being, quality of life and future outcomes. This was explored through two graffiti art sessions and focus groups. Three female participants between the ages of 16 and 18 expressed an interest in taking part in this research, met the inclusion criteria and were recruited. A reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the complied data and three main themes, each with two subthemes were generated: âMeeting Needs &amp; Providing Supportâ, âPeople Make G20â, âTeaching &amp; Divertingâ. The findings of this research are consistent with and add to findings of previous literature suggesting a wide ranging positive impact of youth-led programmes on the lives of young people from deprived neighbourhoods and their wider community. This research supports and has implications for the establishment of more youth-led programmes in deprived neighbourhoods and it highlights the dire need for further future research in this area.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Does the High, Inflexible Precision of Predictions Errors truly explain the lived experiences of autistic individuals?</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> A good autism theory must capture the reality of autistic individuals. A predictive coding framework known as the high, inflexible precision of prediction errors in autism (HIPPEA) theory attempts to explain the autistic experience. Our aim was to understand to what extent the HIPPEA theory resonated with the lived experiences of autistic individuals. A combined qualitative approach was used where themes were identified deductively, based on the HIPPEA theory, and inductively to capture information grounded in participantsâ responses. A total of fifteen participants were recruited for this study. Two online questionnaires were developed - for autistic adults (above 18) and for the parents of autistic children (aged 12-18). Data analysis followed an iterative process, which included concordant assignment of deductive and inductive codes clustered to form provisional themes. Participants highlighted the difficulty of having fixed predictions for every situation, which could not accommodate variations. However, this was valid to different degrees between individuals with many reporting actively interacting with their environments - i.e.Â masking. Whereas experiences of inflexible predictions and necessity of more information to create a generalisation agreed with HIPPEAâs prepositions, others like masking were not easily interpretable. Future research may conduct interviews based on the results to elaborate on the responses.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Intolerance of uncertainty (IU): The Relationship Between IU and traits of ASD</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) has been implemented as a transdiagnostic risk factor for conditions with anxiety related symptoms. In extension, IU is utilised as a theoretical framework for understanding cognitive processes that underpin autistic traits such as sensory sensitivity and insistence-on-sameness. Currently, standardised CBT interventions have low efficacy in autistic samples. IU can be targeted to develop better interventions for autistic individuals to increase tolerance of uncertainty and in effect, manage anxiety related ASD traits. Firstly, the current study investigated the relationship of IU and personality traits including self-report anxiety, sensory sensitivity, and autistic traits. IU research predominantly uses self-report measures and this field lacks behavioural measurements of trait IU. Therefore, our second analysis examined the efficacy of a computer game modelled on the works of Radell et al.Â (2016) to objectively measure trait IU in the general population. The data evidenced a strong significant relationship between self-report measures of IU, autistic traits, and anxiety. Contrary to our hypothesis, sensory sensitivity was not significantly related to trait IU. In addition, the computer game measurement of IU did not significantly correlate with validated self-report measures or ASD personality traits. This suggests that the computer game, in its current form, did not reliably measure trait IU and future replication studies should aim to improve behavioural IU measures. Nevertheless, there is a gap in research for novel testing of trait IU to examine the nuances of the cognitive process that underpins behavioural characteristics of autism. With the purpose of producing IU targeted interventions for long-term, effective management of autistic traits.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> COVID-19 Stress, FOMO and Compliance to COVID-19 Prevention Guidelines in First Year University Students</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Introduction: </strong>COVID-19 related stress and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) are identified as possible predictors of compliance to guidelines in young adults. Park and colleagues (2020) found that COVID-19 stress levels were high, particularly for severity and infection related stressors. Individuals who have high levels of COVID-19 infection stress may demonstrate more hygiene behaviors and caution, thereby complying to government guidelines. FOMO has been linked to various risk-taking behaviors (Riordan et al., 2019), and may be relevant for compliance to guidelines, as non-compliance may also be considered a risk-taking behavior by increasing the risk of infection and by spreading the virus.<br><strong>Methods &amp; Results:</strong> 42 first-year undergraduate students who lived in student halls in Scotland were recruited for an online study. Participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires measuring FOMO, COVID-19 stress and rate of compliance to guidelines. A multiple regression analysis, conducted to assess how well COVID-19 stress and FOMO could predict rate of compliance, indicated a non-significant model for compliance (F(2, 39) = 3.13, p = 0.06, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.138). A linear regression analysis using COVID-19 stress as a predictor of rate of compliance, was run and resulted in a significant model (F(1, 40) = 6.29, p = 0.02, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.136).<br><strong>Discussion: </strong>This study contributes to the limited body of research related to the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated two possible predictors of compliance that had not been researched before. It provides insight into the motivations and barriers to compliance for young adults. The results have implications for student support and compliance protocols. The limitations discussed are centered around the complexity and novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br></p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploring Cultural Differences in Attitudes Towards Restorative Justice Initiatives for Sex Offenders</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Sex offenders have long since been a vulnerable and marginalised group within our society, with the success of their reintegration and desistance depending hugely on protective factors such as adequate housing, employment and stable social networks. Restorative justice initiatives have the opportunity to aid establishing those factors in and out of prison, ultimately reducing reoffending. The Norwegian criminal justice system already incorporates many of those ideas, boasting one of the lowest reoffending rates in the world, in contrast to the British criminal justice system which is more retributive in nature. It is therefore vital to understand public attitudes towards restorative justice initiatives for sex offenders and their underlying reasons in order to potentially change negative attitudes and influence behaviour. The present study explored cultural differences in attitudes towards restorative justice initiatives for sex offenders using focus groups with British and Norwegian participants. Thematic analysis revealed four main themes, namely Internal conflict, Otherness of sex offenders, Practical vs.Â humanistic support, and Cautious conditional agreement. No major differences between British and Norwegian attitudes were found, as well as an overarching, albeit cautious, support for such initiatives. This suggests that public attitudes do not necessarily depend on existing criminal justice systems, showing potential for incorporating restorative justice initiatives for sex offenders into the British system. Implications and directions for future research are discussed, concluding that educating and informing the public about practical benefits of such initiatives is crucial for initiating attitude and social change.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> âYouâre still alone in a room with no one near youâ - Undergraduate Studentsâ Experience of Sense of Belonging During the COVID-19 Pivot to Online Teaching</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> During the COVID-19 pandemic, students were taught online after having signed up to face-to-face teaching. This dissertation study explored how undergraduate students experienced sense of belonging during the pivot to online teaching. A qualitative approach using reflexive thematic analysis allowed for rich insight into studentsâ experience of sense of belonging within the framework of reflexive thematic analysis, harnessing the student position of the researcher. Seventeen participants were recruited via social media and an institutional participant pool. Four semi-structured online focus groups were conducted and recorded in January 2021. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Analysis identified four themes related to students experience of a sense of belonging. Students reacted to an experience of increased isolation they felt by cultivating a stronger sense of academic belonging through personal relationships with individual staff and students. They relied on these groups to take on responsibilities where they perceived the university as an institution to fail in supporting their peers which they identified as reasons for feeling alienated. Studentsâ experience of sense of belonging was similar to earlier research but experienced more acutely through changing relationships due to the lack of in-person interaction on campus. The importance of opportunities for interaction with peers and staff should be considered in the pivot back to traditional teaching.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Making Sense of Family: A Story Completion Study of Birth Children of Foster Carers</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Despite identifying themselves as active participants in the foster family unit, the contributions of birth children of foster carers to the foster family have been consistently neglected in research and policy. The literature that does exist on birth children of foster carers often focuses on them with the purpose of improving the outcomes of the foster child, not the birth child themselves. This study aims to explore how birth children of foster carers make sense of being in a foster family through story completion, a recently developed and promising qualitative methodology. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted on 34 story completion texts from 17 UK based birth children of foster carers, aged 8-49 years. Three themes were identified: costs, family identity, and empathy. These themes further current research by refining the key markers of birth childrenâs experience and highlighting the strategies employed by birth children to make sense of their experience. Participants showed an aptitude for positively resolving the more negative aspects of fostering, which supports literature attributing birth children of foster carersâ resilience to their secure attachment. Additional implications of findings are discussed, concluding that birth children of foster carers should be more widely recognised for their role in the foster family unit, better supported through it, and more officially involved in the decisions and processes of fostering.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Gesture Perception in Major Depression: An Investigation using fMRI Data</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterised by biased perception of biological motion (i.e., human movement). Considering that gestures, a subtype of biological motion, are particularly important for communication, this study investigated the neural correlates of gesture perception in MDD. We expected different neural activity between individuals with MDD and healthy individuals when viewing negatively or positively valenced instrumental and expressive gestures, potentially manifesting in brain areas associated with gesture perception, including superior temporal, frontal and emotion processing regions. This was examined using an unpublished functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset that contained data from 12 participants with MDD and 12 control participants who were scanned while viewing displays of point-light gestures. The results of a random effects three-way mixed ANOVA indicated that individuals with MDD had greater activity in the right claustrum compared to healthy individuals, regardless of gesture type or valence. This could reflect a greater effort to associate sensory, motor and limbic information, or it could reflect altered attention during gesture perception in MDD. Replications with larger samples are encouraged to extend these initial findings to enhance an understanding of how gesture perception is affected in MDD in order to inform assessment and treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploring the Relationship between Life Satisfaction, Belief in Conspiracy Theories and Trust in Science and Scientists</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The present study examined the relationship between the life satisfaction, belief in generic conspiracies and trust in science and scientists. A sample of 203 participants aged 18-45 years (M = 23.5, SD = 4.95) completed the three scales Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Generic Conspiracists Beliefs Scale (GCBS), and Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory (TISSI) in an online study. No significant relationships were observed between SWLS and GCBS, nor between SLWS and TISSI. The hypothesis that higher life satisfaction would be related to greater trust in science and a lower rate of endorsement of conspiracy theories was not supported. An exploratory correlation found a moderate negative relationship between scores on GCBS and TISSI, suggesting that higher belief in conspiracies is linked to lower trust in science. Gender differences were examined using linear models and the only significant difference, yet underpowered, was found on SWLS in participants who did not identify as female nor male. Other linear model analyses did not report significant findings on GCBS nor on TISSI. Higher age was weakly positively correlated with SWLS and TISSI, and weakly negatively correlated with GCBS. Limitations and implications are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Relationship of Autistic Traits, Intolerance of Uncertainty (IoU) and Anxiety in the General Population</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Introduction: </strong>Intolerance of Uncertainty (IoU) has been positively associated with and potentially moderates Anxiety and autistic traits in clinical Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) populations. However, some limited research has found the strength of this relationship to be equivalent in neurotypical populations. Autistic traits also exist on a continuum within general population, and as such it stands to reason that both IoU and autistic traits will also influence their levels of anxiety.<br></p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Recruited participants completed an online study consisting of a series of questionnaires measuring IoU (IUS-12), Autistic Traits (AQ-10) and Anxiety (GAD-7).<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>The data from 96 participants was included in the study (Mean age = 28.8 years, SD age =14.5 years; 68.8% female, 27.1% male, 3.1% non-binary, 1% preferred not to say). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis determined that IoU significantly predicted anxiety (F(1, 94) = 58.53, p &lt; .001, adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = .377), and that the addition of autistic traits did not significantly increase the variance explained (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>R2 = .370, p &lt; .001), nor the model fit (F(2, 93) = 28.97, p &lt;.001, F change = .015, p = .898. This was corroborated in between-subjects t-tests which found no significant difference between high and low scoring AQ groups on either the IUS-12 or GAD-7.<br></p>
<p><strong>Discussion: </strong>This study highlights the importance of IoU to the development and maintenance of anxiety in the general population. We crucially investigated two possible predictors of anxiety which have previously been explored extensively in ASD populations but neglected within the general population. Implications of this research include the possible targeting of IoU in anxiety treatments for use in the wider general population as well as autistic individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Introduction: </strong>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, most organisations throughout the world have implemented a work from home policy in order to abide social distancing restrictions. For many organisations this has meant that the workforce has moved to a completely virtual working environment.<br></p>
<p><strong>Aim: </strong>The aim of this study is to collect rich, qualitative data in order to explore the opinions of senior leaders regarding their experiences of a year of virtual teamwork during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br></p>
<p><strong>Method: </strong>This explorative study involves five participants from the senior leadership team of one of the largest multinational beverage companies in the world. One-on-one interviews were held over a Microsoft Teams video call with each participant in order to ascertain their current opinions of virtual teamwork. The data was then analysed using a thematic analysis technique.<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>Seven core themes were found most applicable to the research question. They were explored and supported using interview extracts.

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Online Interventions to Improve Studentsâ Sleep: A Systematic Review</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Background: </strong>Sleep issues are alarmingly prevalent in university students - in which insomnia or inadequate sleep quality can have hugely detrimental effects on studentsâ mental health. Regarding the accessibility concerns surrounding face-to-face therapies, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a robust assessment of the effectiveness of online sleep interventions in improving studentsâ sleep is warranted.<br></p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Five databases were searched from inception to December 2020 - in which eight studies met eligibility criteria pertaining to the main categories: students, insomnia, and online interventions. Two independent reviewers completed the screening, data extraction, and risk of bias processes. Additionally, this systematic review was pre-registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020214026).<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>The eight included studies represented data from 4720 students with varied severity of insomnia symptoms or poor sleep quality. Three included studies were quasi-experimental in design. Most interventions were based on at least one component of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Across the studies, outcome effects were largest within the comprehensive online CBT-I interventions.<br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Our findings, in line with previous literature, validates online CBT-I as effective for improving sleep in students. Future studies, however, should explore the effects of such interventions across diverse samples, study designs, delivery methods, and intervention types. Fundamentally, whilst this review demonstrates the progress made regarding online support mechanisms, our findings highlight the advancements still to be made for developing accessible services for students.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Using Virtual Reality to Recreate the Synaesthetic Experience</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Synaesthesia is a condition where people experience unusual sensory or cognitive sensations in response to apparently unrelated stimuli. The present study aimed to examine whether Virtual Reality (VR) technology can be used to recreate the synaesthetic experience. There is a lack of research in this area, with most studies focussing primarily on synaesthetic colours. This study aimed to build on previous research by using both a traditional colour-picker and VR to capture a more nuanced picture of synaesthesia. A multiple case study design was used to examine a small number of participantsâ experiences in detail. Data gathering took place via Zoom. During the initial data-gathering session, participants used a colour-picker to provide grapheme-colour associations. After this session, some of the participantsâ synaesthetic experiences were recreated in VR. Results indicated that VR is capable of capturing certain elements of synaesthesia that other methods have been unable to, such as texture and small degrees of movement. Limitations and future directions, including moving to a multi-user VR set-up, are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Objectives: </strong>The Covid-19 pandemic has provoked poor mental health in the general population due to restrictions being implemented, as well as fear of catching the virus. Body focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs), such as skin-picking and hairpulling, are comorbid with poor mental health. Students are a high-risk category for developing mental health disorders. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate poor mental health and BFRBs in students during the Covid-19 pandemic, in a non-clinical sample.<br></p>

<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Two hundred and six participants completed the Covid-19 Stress Scale (CSS; adapted from the Swine Flu Inventory), Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales - 21 Items (DASS-21), Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HPS) and the Skin-Picking Scale - Revised (SPS-R).<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>BFRBs were particularly prevalent in the student sample, with 57.8% reporting skin-picking behaviours and 32.5% reporting hairpulling behaviours. Participants reported high scores on the DASS-21 and the CSS. Skin-picking was positively correlated with DASS-21 and CSS scores. However, there was no relationship found between hairpulling scores and DASS-21 and CSS scores. <br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Skin-picking and hairpulling behaviours were prevalent in the non-clinical student sample. However, hairpulling was not correlated with mental health and Covid-19 stress. This may be due to the fact that skin-picking was more prevalent in this sample. We hope that this study will stimulate further investigation into these areas.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Stigma Towards Surrogate Mothers is Predicted by Pathogen, Sexual and Moral Disgust</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Previous studies have revealed that surrogate mothers experience exclusion and stigma. Empirical research has evidenced a relationship between individual differences in pathogen disgust and stigma towards individuals without potential cues of infection (e.g., people with mental health conditions, immigrants, homosexuals), which supports the notion that overgeneralised disease avoidance may partly explain stigma (Oaten et al., 2011). Thus, we tested the relationship between the pathogen (main predictor), sexual and moral disgust (exploratory predictors) subscales of the Three Domain Disgust Scale (Tybur et al., 2009) and stigma, as measured by the Social Distance Scale (Link et al., 1987), towards four types of surrogate mothers: genetic, gestational, altruistic and commercial, in a sample of 229 participants. Contrary to our hypothesis, multiple regression analyses revealed that pathogen disgust did not significantly predict stigma towards genetic, altruistic and commercial surrogate mothers; pathogen disgust only significantly predicted stigma towards gestational surrogate mothers. However, other patterns were found. Sexual disgust significantly predicted stigma towards genetic and gestational surrogate mothers. Moral disgust was negatively related to stigma towards altruistic surrogate mothers. These results suggest that stigma towards surrogate mothers may be explained by the implication of different functional domains of disgust.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Pathogen Disgust Sensitivity as a predictor of Mental Disorder Stigma: Testing the moderating effect of Pathogen Cue Priming</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Disgust is often characterised as an evolutionary pathogen avoidance mechanism. It has previously been hypothesised that human pathogen avoidance mechanisms, measured by individual differences in pathogen disgust sensitivity, may overgeneralise to produce false alarms in the form of stigma, even when no pathogen threat is present. Past studies have suggested that pathogen disgust sensitivity predicts stigmatisation towards several groups, including those with certain mental illnesses. The present study sought to expand the range of mental disorders for which the relationship is studied for by examining 3 previously unstudied mental disorders (Bipolar, OCD and BPD) and compare these to one previously studied one (schizophrenia). An additional aim of the present study was to examine the potential moderating effect of pathogen cue priming on the strength of this relationship. Regression analyses (N = 96) indicated significant relationships for sexual disgust sensitivity and stigmatisation towards all disorders, as well as pathogen disgust sensitivity and stigmatisation towards BPD and schizophrenia. No moderating effect of pathogen cue priming was detected for any mental disorder. Pathogen and sexual disgust sensitivity are interpreted as disease-avoidance and mate choice-related heuristic evaluations contributing to stigmatisation of those with mental disorders. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research and stigma reduction interventions are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Examining Facial Expressions as Social Tools</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> This secondary analysis aimed to verify and expand upon the emotion overgeneralisation theory. We explored whether semantic similarity in positive (happy, delighted, joy) and negative emotions (anger, fury, rage) is reflected in facial expressions and perceived social traits (trustworthiness, dominance); further, whether patterns of facial movements play a role in facially conveying these semantically related emotions and eliciting perceptions of associated social traits. Our correlation and clustering findings suggest moderate overgeneralisation effects for all semantically related emotions, apart from anger. Clustering did reveal differences in similarity for related emotions, limiting the extent of a functional basis driving perceptions of semantically related emotions and associated traits. We determined distinct Action Units (AUs) which were important for perceptions of happiness and trustworthiness - Dimpler and Lip Corner Puller. Various Upper Lip Raisers and the Nose Wrinkler were important for perceptions of dominance, but less for negative emotions. Implications and limitations are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Pathogen Disgust Predicts Stigmatisation of Individuals with Neurodevelopmental Disorders</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Individuals that present signs of illness or contagion are often avoided to protect oneself from harmful infection. Those with noncontagious conditions (e.g., facial lesions or physical disabilities) are consequently stigmatised due to the overinclusive nature of this disease-avoidance mechanism. Recent findings suggest that pathogen disgust predicts the stigmatisation of individuals with mental health conditions, however research in this field is limited. This study systematically investigates the theory that an overgeneralisation of pathogen disgust, as a subscale of the Three-Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS), will similarly contribute to the stigmatisation of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. A sample of 125 participants (92 female, 30 male, 3 non-binary) completed the TDDS to index pathogen, sexual and moral disgust, and the AQ-27 to indicate the level of stigma towards four neurodevelopmental disorders; autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Touretteâs syndrome (TS) and cerebral palsy (CP). Results from a mixed effects analysis revealed that pathogen disgust predicted the stigmatisation of the four neurodevelopmental disorders. Conversely, scores from the moral disgust subscale showed a negative effect and the sexual disgust subscale did not have any relation to the stigmatisation of the disorders. Separate analysis of the disorders exemplified that pathogen disgust had a significant positive effect on the stigmatisation of ASD, TS and CP, but not ADHD. The main findings are broadly consistent with previous research and suggest an overgeneralised disease-avoidance mechanism may partly account for the stigmatisation of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Assessing Emotional Experience during the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Situated Perspective on Emotion Differentiation</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Emotion differentiation, known as the ability to make fine-grained distinctions between like-valenced states, has been repeatedly linked to improved well-being, enhanced emotion regulation competencies and reduced distress (Barrett et al., 2001; Kashdan et al., 2015; Starr et al., 2019). Previous assessments of this emotional skill disregarded the fact that this construct is likely to vary considerably across different life situations. To overcome this limitation, we used the Situated Assessment Method (SAM<sup>2</sup>) to develop three situated measures of emotion differentiation anchored in various facets of affective functioning. 87 subjects participated in an online survey and rated 17 stressful, non-stressful and eustressful Covid-19 life situations on eleven features relevant to emotional experience (e.g., emotion intensity, valence). Participants also completed standard, decontextualized self-report tools measuring alexithymia, emotion differentiation, emotion regulation, perceived stress and personality variables. Intraclass correlation coefficients revealed that participants differed substantially in their emotional ratings across the Covid-19 life situations. Furthermore, the individual SAM<sup>2</sup> measures of emotion differentiation correlated significantly, yet negatively with the SAM<sup>2</sup> score of emotion regulation, unsituated perceived stress and neuroticism. An exploratory multiple linear regression found that perceived stress significantly predicted the overall SAM<sup>2</sup> measure of emotion differentiation. These unexpected findings challenge the existing scholarly assumptions about emotion granularity, while providing evidence for the importance of real-life contexts in the assessment of multifaceted psychological constructs.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Differentiated Neural Response to a Cross-Modal Imagery Paradigm in Aphantasic and Normally Sighted Participants: A Granger Causality Mapping Study</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> It is currently unclear whether mental imagery is a necessary component of cross-modal feedback to early sensory cortices. Furthermore, the specific neural mechanisms which would subserve such a process are not entirely understood. To find answers to these questions, we gathered data collected in two previous studies which employed a cross-modal imagery paradigm in normally sighted and aphantasic populations. Using Granger Causality Mapping, we undertook an exploratory investigation into whether salient differences could be observed in the neural responses of these populations to this paradigm. Results generally did not show unambiguous task-relevant differences. However, activity was commonly seen to emerge in the default mode network in both populations, and cross-comparison revealed exclusive activity in the parahippocampal gyrus in normally sighted participants. With reference to literature, we tentatively suggest that this may represent a difference in functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the cortical nodes of the default mode network in aphantasic and normally sighted participants. This could theoretically account for results seen in previous studies investigating the relevance of imagery to cross-modal feedback to early sensory cortices. Implications and future directions are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> A Content Analysis of Gender Roles in the Expression of Negative Emotions in Children Cartoon Series</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Emotions are complex cognitive and physiological states that are tightly intertwined with subjective wellbeing and mental health. It is therefore key to regulate negative emotions adaptively, which is linked to emotion expression, and to avoid maladaptive strategies like suppression. Emotional competences are learnt throughout childhood and can be trained. However, current norms of gender roles in negative emotion expression may contribute to the suppression of internalising emotions in males, and of externalising emotions in females, thereby contributing to differential mental unhealth across genders. The media may reinforce the harmful gendered norms of negative emotion expression, as it tends to depict genders stereotypically. This study aims to determine whether the expression of negative emotions in current childrenâs cartoons is depicted as gendered or as neutral. The frequency of 5 pre-selected categories of negative emotions was analysed in the content of 10 episodes of the cartoon series called âLe Monde Incroyable de Gumballâ. In a total of 77 minutes of viewing, 223 negative emotions were identified. The most frequent emotions were anger (39.9%) and fear (29.6%), followed by âotherâ unspecified negative emotions (17.5%), sadness (8.1%), and finally disgust (4.9%). Age of the characters was controlled. Findings revealed a relationship between gender and anger expression across ages, with males expressing less anger than females, surprisingly. Gender did not predict the expression of any of the remaining four categories of negative emotions. Exploratory analysis revealed a relationship between age and âotherâ unspecified negative emotions, with children expressing more of it than adults. Results are explained in light of the contemporary feminist movement, although more research is needed to confirm the observed results.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The effect of switching to online teaching and assessment during COVID-19 on test anxiety and preparedness in undergraduate students</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The impacts on social interaction due to COVID-19 have been wide and varied, most clearly illustrated in the changes to how university teaching and assessment has taken place since March 2020. The effects of these changes on test anxiety and preparation for online exams in UK undergraduates has yet to be considered in-depth, therefore we conducted a qualitative study to determine the individual experiences of this in a cohort of undergraduate/recent graduate students. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was performed on the collected data and results showed variable experiences of five common factors of the sudden move to online teaching and exams which emerged. These factors were; environment, exam format, a timeline of anxiety, staff/student communication and reflection. The individual experiences of these elements and further possible impacts on future implementation of online exams and research in this area are discussed in-depth below.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Mindfulness and self-compassion account for a large amount of variance in the relationship between autism and camouflaging</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> This study was the first to investigate the links between mindfulness, self-compassion, autistic traits, camouflaging, depression and anxiety in a non-clinical female sample. The aims of the study were to examine whether (i) autistic traits would positively predict camouflaging, (ii) whether mindfulness and self-compassion would negatively predict autistic traits and camouflaging, and (iii) whether mindfulness and self-compassion would explain variance in the relationship between autistic traits and camouflaging. Further, an exploratory analysis was conducted to investigate whether mindfulness and self-compassion would explain variance in the relationship between autism and self-compassion over and above depression and anxiety. 141 participants responded to an online survey composed of measures of autistic traits (BAPQ), camouflaging (CAT-Q), self-compassion (SCS), mindfulness (FFMQ), anxiety (STICSA Trait) and depression (DASS-D). Correlations between variables were calculated and two hierarchical linear regressions were performed. All the experimental hypotheses were supported, indicating that mindfulness and self-compassion may be important intervention targets for autistic individuals prone to camouflaging. Limitations of the current study will be discussed, as well as suggestions for future research and the implications for the female phenotype of autism.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Data Sharing and Hypothesis generation: A pilot study</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Data sharing has become a hallmark of reproducibility in psychological studies. However, data sharing is prone to privacy related vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the effects of data sharing on influencing the hypothesis generation process have been severely under-researched. This is potentially problematic considering that the format of data sharing or knowledge of relationships contained within the data might bias generated hypotheses. This pilot study builds on the need to research the hypothesis generation process by employing a novel experimental design. Two synthetic datasets were developed by simulating existing data which de-identified and anonymised them, one containing significant relationships between the data, and one containing no significant relationships. Combinations of these, alongside a codebook, were downloaded by participants (N=71) who were tasked with generating hypotheses based on the received files. While a one-way ANOVA showed no significant differences on how different formats of data sharing influence the number of generated hypotheses, these findings were deemed as inconclusive due to extremely small cell sizes. Furthermore, a logistic binomial regression comparing return rates between participants downloading their files to submitting hypotheses found no significant differences across conditions. A thematic analysis conducted on the generated hypotheses suggested that while most hypotheses displayed clear directionality, almost half of the hypotheses contained ambiguous wording or were generally untestable. Limitations of the study were also addressed, namely issues with sample and cell. Finally, suggestions towards future research were given, namely, to avoid power calculations using effect sizes found in this study but to employ sequential analyses and improved retention strategies to reach optimal participation rates across conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Does Facial Age Differentially Affect the Sex Categorisation of Male and Female Faces? A Replication Study</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> We are able to tell the sex of an unfamiliar face within milliseconds, which has important downstream consequences for social interaction. Whilst research suggests that a variety of cues contribute to the sex categorisation of faces, little is known about how orthogonal facial dimensions, such as facial age, modulate this process. Here, I replicated a sex categorisation experiment by Kloth et al.Â (2015) to investigate how older facial age influenced the efficiency and accuracy with which the sex of unfamiliar faces was categorised. 244 participants categorised the sex of face stimuli ranging in age from young to middle-aged and old. Accuracy and response latencies were analysed by replicating Kloth et al.Â (2015)âs ANOVA analysis, and then computing mixed-effects models and hierarchical shift functions. My results were consistent with an asymmetric influence of facial age on sex categorisation, where older male faces are categorised faster and more accurately than young faces, whilst inversely female faces are harder to categorise with increased age. However, these outcomes need to be replicated in controlled environments with robust statistical methods for further insight into the intersection of perceptual processing and contextual factors in face categorisation.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Stigma Towards Offenders with Mental Illness: An Investigation of Empathy and Mental Illness Symptomatology</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Background: </strong>Mental health disorders are highly prevalent in offender populations, occurring 4.5-5 times more than the general population. One possible explanation is the deinstituitionalisation of state psychiatric care which led to the criminalisation of individuals with severe mental illness. As a result, negative attitudes and stigmatisation are seen towards offenders with mental illness by the general public. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between stigmatising attitudes, trait empathy and mental illness symptomatology as well as whether certain mental illnesses were more stigmatised than others.<br></p>
<p><strong>Method: </strong>A within-subjects correlational design was used. Attitudes towards offenders with mental illness were measured using the Public Attitudes Towards Offenders with Mental Illness scale (PATOMI; developed by Walkden et al., 2020). Empathy was measured using the Brief Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Three vignettes, portraying three mental health disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were used to investigate stigmatising attitudes across mental health symptomatology.<br></p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong>107 participantsâ data was analysed using a Spearman rank correlation to investigate the relationship between the variables. A moderate positive significant correlation was found between levels of empathy and PATOMI scores (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.34, p = &lt;.001). BPD was shown to be the most stigmatised vignette in comparison to schizophrenia (p = .008) and bipolar disorder (p &lt;.001).<br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>As levels of empathy rose, less stigmatising attitudes towards mentally ill offenders were seen. BPD was revealed to be the most stigmatised vignette, indicating a need for further public education and interventions.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Dark Personality Traits and Sociopolitical Ideologies: Investigating the Dual Process Motivational Model of Prejudice</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Research investigating prejudice has demonstrated how different personality traits can predispose and lead to prejudicial social and political attitudes. More recently, the dual process motivational (DPM) model of prejudice which emphasises the mediating role of political personality traits, specifically right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), on the association between different classes of personality traits and prejudice, has been widely supported. The most recent research in the field has specifically focused on the interplay between dark personality traits, collective narcissism, political personality traits, and prejudice. This study built upon and extended research in the area to integrate the Dark Tetrad of personality traits into the DPM model to investigate prejudice towards refugees. Mediation analysis found significant mediation effects of RWA and SDO on the relationship between prejudice, collective narcissism and the Dark Core, however, results from confirmatory factor analysis did not support the predicted latent variables of the Dark Core, collective narcissism, and prejudice. Findings are discussed in terms of support for the DPM model and directions for future research.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploring the Extent Meta-Dehumanisation Influences the Relationship Between Subjective Social Status and Psychological Well-being</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> <strong>Objective: </strong>Low socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to diminished health outcomes, reduced psychological wellbeing and dehumanisation. Meta-dehumanisation occurs when a person believes they are being perceived as less than fully human. Research indicates that meta-dehumanisation is potentially an important factor in the connection between SES and psychological wellbeing. This study aims to further explore the relationship between meta-dehumanisation, SSS and psychological wellbeing.<br><strong>Method: </strong>Data from a cross-sectional sample of 123 student participants from the University of Glasgow was collected via an online questionnaire. SSS was determined using the 10-step community focused MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status. Meta-dehumanisation was determined using an adapted version of the 8-item dehumanisation scale by Bastian et al.Â (2012) and psychological wellbeing was determined using the 42-item scale by Ryff and Keyes (1995).<br><strong>Results: </strong>Overall, SSS and meta-dehumanisation together explained over a third of the variance in psychological wellbeing (adj. R<sup>2</sup>=.3463, p&lt;0.001). Psychological wellbeing variance was also well explained individually by both SSS (R<sup>2</sup>=.1396, p&lt;0.001) and meta-dehumanisation (R<sup>2</sup>=.2897, p&lt;0.001). Meta-dehumanisation explained over half of the variance in the SSS and psychological wellbeing relationship.<br><strong>Conclusions: </strong>The results indicate a significant relationship between SSS, meta-dehumanisation and psychological wellbeing. While further research is needed, these findings have implications for our understanding of the SSS wellbeing relationship and could help improve mental health support for people of lower-SSS.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> The Relationship Between the Listenersâ Personality and Their Perception of the Voice Trustworthiness</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The voice contains a lot of socially relevant information allowing individuals to form first impressions of others. Research on the voice has vastly focused on establishing how the impression of the voice informs and influences the perception and judgments about the personality of the speaker. Less attention has been placed on how the personality of the listeners affects their perception of the speakerâs personality from the voice. The current study aimed to fill the gap in the research and examined this relationship. A negative correlation was hypothesised between the socially-oriented extraversion trait of the listeners and their perception of vocal trustworthiness. Thirty-one undergraduate participants completed an online experiment consisting of a voice discrimination task, where they judged the presented morphed voice stimuli as either more trustworthy or less trustworthy, and of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality questionnaire. The correlational analysis looked at the relationship between the participantsâ averaged responses to the voice discrimination task, indicated by the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE), and their averaged scores to the extraversion items from the BFI. The results indicated a non-significant relationship between these two variables. The findings are discussed along with the existing literature on the socially oriented nature of individuals high in extraversion and the relationship extraversion has with the perception of socially relevant stimuli. The limitations of the current study and potential directions for future research are also discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> A Meta-Analysis to Quantify Lateralised Spatial Attention Bias (Pseudoneglect) in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Hemispheric specialisation is associated with behavioural biases, some with clinical relevance. A neurotypical right hemispheric dominance for visuospatial attention explains the slight leftward spatial bias that exists in a healthy population. This bias is known as pseudoneglect. Hemispheric dysfunctionality, as observed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), on the other hand, has been theorised to lead to a deviation from typical pseudoneglect, characterised by either a reduction in leftward bias, or an inverted rightward bias. A body of literature has developed which aims to characterise this bias in ADHD, but studies report mixed results with biases of varying laterality and magnitude. Here, I have performed a meta-analysis to determine the existence, laterality and magnitude of a spatial bias in people of all ages with ADHD or suspected ADHD, and to explore the factors of moderation that could explain the heterogeneity of spatial bias in ADHD. A total of 11 studies were included, totalling 331 participants, based on the criterion that spatial bias was tested with the commonly used line bisection, landmark, or greyscales tasks. An increased ADHD diagnosis in children compared to adults, or increased recognition of symptoms in children with ADHD, has led to a literature that characterises predominantly childhood ADHD. Thus, the mean age of participants in this meta-analysis was 13.2 years. Due to specificities of the sample, three separate meta-analyses were performed: one with studies using the line bisection, landmark, or greyscales task (n = 11), one with studies using the predominant line bisection task (n = 8), and one revised version of the line bisection task analysis following the valid removal of a study outlier (n = 7). The latter analysis revealed a rightward lateralised spatial bias that is significantly different to zero in people with ADHD. Sex, age, and task modality were analysed as moderating variables, but had no effects. ADHD subtype could not be analysed as moderator variable due to limited data, but 3 is discussed along with other relevant variables e.g., task type, handedness. Overall, these results reveal a rightward spatial bias in people with ADHD. However, the results of this meta-analysis need to be interpreted with caution in light of its many limitations. More studies are needed to characterise spatial bias in ADHD, and properly assess the impact of moderating variables.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploration of the Relationship between Studentsâ Social Ability, Academic Motivation, and Cognitive Load in Online Learning Environments</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The current research employed a sequential explanatory mixed methods design to add to the limited literature surrounding social ability in online learning environments. This study studied the relationship between social ability, academic motivation, and cognitive load. Questionnaires were administered to first-year psychology students (N = 40). Eight follow-up interviews were conducted, to glean student perceptions of the role of social ability on academic motivation and cognitive load. Regression analyses indicated that studentâs intrinsic and extrinsic motivation could be predicted by social navigation and social connectedness. Later interviews suggested that students felt isolation from peers and experienced the sense that lecturers were not heavily involved in their learning experience. The importance of social navigation on motivation was seen through social media groups as a way to expand knowledge and improve their own work. Social connectedness was important as students valued the feeling that other students were in the same situation as them, with these feelings acting as a motivator to persist with university. Implications for the findings for educational practice and future research and limitations are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Title: </strong> Exploring the Relationship Between Disgust Sensitivity and Internalised Stigma in Trichotillomania and Dermatillomania</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The behavioural immune system aids humans in avoiding pathogens in the environment. However, this system may be overgeneralised, leading to the avoidance and stigmatisation of individuals with non-infectious conditions, such as body-focussed repetitive behaviours (BFRBs). We investigated whether this overgeneralisation extends to internalised stigma. It was anticipated that pathogen disgust, not sexual or moral disgust, would predict self-stigma in those with BFRBs. A correlational design was employed to investigate the relationship between disgust sensitivity and self-stigma in individuals with trichotillomania symptomatology and dermatillomania symptomatology. A final sample of 527 participants was recruited through social media and BFRB-oriented forums. Participants completed an appropriate screening questionnaire for the BFRB condition they most identified with. Self-stigma and disgust sensitivity were then measured using an adapted version of the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness-Brief scale (ISMI-B) and the Three Domains of Disgust Scale (TDDS), respectively. Through multiple regression analyses, we found that sexual disgust, and not moral or pathogen disgust, predicted self-stigma in our total sample and our trichotillomania sub-sample (p &lt; .001). No domain of disgust significantly predicted self-stigma for those with dermatillomania symptomatology, with the full model also found to be non-significant (p = .275). These results indicate that the behavioural immune system may not be involved in the self-stigmatisation of individuals with trichotillomania and dermatillomania, at least in the context of pathogen disgust. Alternative explanations and implications for future research and practice are discussed.</p>
