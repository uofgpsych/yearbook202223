**Abstract:** Commonly used categorical measures of gender provide only limited response options and are exclusive of non-binary and genderqueer individuals making them invisible in research. More inclusive gender measures have been suggested and a free response format has been recommended. However, no previous studies have assessed how gender measures make non-binary and genderqueer participants invisible and no insights exists on how they respond to gender questions with exclusive response options. To answer this question, participants (n = 924) responded to a Binary, a Short and a LongList, and a Free Response gender assessment format. Additionally, participants rated how represented they felt by the options provided by each format and were asked for additional comments. The results show that the majority of Non-binary (n = 323) participants opted to use binary response options when no non-binary options were available. The Free response and the Long list were most sensitive to recording Non-binary participants and both Binary (n = 519) and Non-binary participants felt most represented by the Free response question. The objection that free response gender questions cause an increase in missing data is found to be unsupported and the concern that responses are too time-consuming or difficult to code is addressed. It is concluded that a free response question accompanied by guidance on why gender is assessed and how responses will be coded is a gender assessment format that is both feasible to process and inclusive of non-binary and genderqueer individuals.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption to higher education. Subsequently, universities replaced traditional face-to-face exams with online exams. There is little research investigating student's test anxiety in online exams during the pandemic. Previous research has shown that COVID-19 has exacerbated students' anxiety levels and that increased general anxiety can increase test anxiety.  However, completing online exams has shown to significantly reduce test anxiety. Firstly, this study aimed to investigate if there was a difference in self-reported anxiety for online exams during COVID-19 compared to face-to-face exams. And secondly, to investigate what significantly predicted preference for online exams or face-to-face exams. Test anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety scores were calculated, and regression analyses assessed multiple predictor variables for test anxiety and preference for online or face-to-face exams regarding exam preparation, exam performance, exam anxiety and preferred format. A sample including 208 university students (ages 18-36) completed an online survey, collecting data regarding demographic information, COVID-19 anxiety, exam information, test anxiety and overall preferred exam format. Results confirmed the gender difference in test anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety. Informing our first aim, students reported less anxiety for online exams in comparison to face-to-face exams. Informing our second aim, no variables significantly predicted preference for online or face-to-face exams. However, GPA and COVID-19 anxiety significantly predicted test anxiety. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety and test anxiety positively correlated. Findings were discussed in relation to the research aims, the study's strengths and limitations. The implications of exploratory COVID-19 research for the future of higher education and suggestions for future research are proposed. This study concluded that students were less anxious for online exams but did not have an overall preference for online or face-to-face exams.

**Abstract:** Reducing meat consumption is imperative to limit greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further warming of the earth's atmosphere. Investigating how people think about food will help us understand why many do not follow a plant-based diet, despite its benefits. This study used a feature listing task to examine how meat eaters and vegans represent meat and plant-based food, and the relation this has to eating motivations. 220 participants were presented with a range of food dishes and instructed to list features that describe each dish. Features were coded into categories and analysed quantitatively. Eating motives were assessed using a questionnaire. Results showed that both groups think about foods in their diet, and foods they find attractive, in terms of the consumption experience. Foods outside a person's diet were thought about in terms of features independent of a specific situation.  When making a food choice, both groups were equally motivated by factors relating to the consumption experience, but vegans had greater environmental and ethical motivations than meat eaters. There was no relationship between eating motives and feature listing responses - those with long-term eating motivations (e.g. health and ethics) did not implicitly think about food any differently than those with more immediate motivations (e.g. liking and hunger). The study provides evidence that spontaneous eating simulations occur when a person thinks about the food they eat, regardless of diet or explicit eating motivations. This could have important implications for the promotion of sustainable diets.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Insomnia has been associated with anxiety-related disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Investigations regarding the mediating effects between OCD symptoms and insomnia have often focused on anxiety and depression, whereas there is a lack of research investigating the mediating effects of perfectionism and sleep-related worry (SRW) between OCD symptoms and insomnia. This study aimed to assess the relationship between student's OCD symptoms, perfectionism, and sleep-related worries between their symptoms of insomnia. 74 undergraduate and postgraduate university students completed the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale; the Sleep Condition Indicator; the Almost Perfect Scale Revised; and the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire. A multiple linear regression showed that increased SRW and perfectionism were associated with increased symptoms of insomnia, but there was no relationship between OCD symptoms and insomnia symptoms. Mediation analysis did reveal that OCD symptoms were associated with increased insomnia symptoms through increased perfectionism, but not SRW. Those with OCD may misinterpret the perfectionist thoughts associated with not being able to achieve high standards, generating anxiety and a level of cognitive arousal that disrupts sleep. Additionally, SRW may disrupt sleep through an over-evaluation of the consequences of poor sleep, thus maintaining an arousal state that continues to delay sleep onset, providing more time which an individual might spend attempting to fall asleep and thus worrying about sleep.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Research on voice identity perception has extensively studied between-speaker variability in an attempt to understand how listeners tell people apart. Within-speaker variability, the way the same voice varies across situations, has mostly been eliminated in these studies, effectively treating it as a form of random noise that impairs voice identity perception. However, recent studies focusing on the ability to tell people together suggest that within-speaker variability is speaker-specific and plays an equally important role in identifying others. This study attempted to quantitatively verify these claims by training and testing a machine-learning model on variable and non-variable voice samples, examining emerging differences in identification accuracy based on differences in their training and test sets. Our results revealed that the complexity of variable voices makes them more difficult to identify compared to non-variable voices. However, the model was also able to extract speaker-specific information from variable voice samples that improved identification accuracy for variable voices. These findings show that within-speaker variability provides important cues for the identification of naturally varying voices, highlighting the need for further research on its role in voice identity perception, as well as demonstrating how the use of machine-learning models can benefit future psychological research.

**Abstract:** In today's climate, the media has become a vital source of information that shapes children's understanding and perceptions of gender. Prevailing literature emphasises the underrepresentation and stereotyped portrayals of female characters within children's entertainment, with their presence only serving to reinforce a male-dominated narration. The current study explores the existence of such disparities in children's favourite television and films of today, given that traditional gender roles are diminishing in society than recognised in prior research. I performed a content analysis on a sample of 65 television programmes, films and media identified by children - investigating the proportion of male and female characters in lead, minor and title roles, and the various descriptive roles they fulfilled. I aimed to investigate how this interacted with children's character and watching preferences. The analysis indicated that there continues to be an underrepresentation of women on screen - with female characters outnumbered in lead, minor and title roles. While gender-role stereotypes persisted in the current sample of programmes, there were noticeable improvements in the types of roles and occupations portrayed characters, and the emergence of counter-gender stereotyped characters also. The significance of this is discussed in relation to children's gender identity, role-models, and implications to mental health.
