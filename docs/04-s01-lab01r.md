**Abstract:** People who suffer from mental illnesses are often stigmatized by society, and this stigma discourages them from seeking psychological treatment or any treatment at all (Corrigan & Watson, 2002). Individuals from ethnic minority communities are often subjected to double stigmatisation (Faye, 2005). This is due to bigotry and stigmatisation stemming from their race, as well as stigmatisation stemming from their mental illness. Additionally, Individuals from ethnic minority groups often experience problems within their own societies as a result of traditional and cultural views (Arday, 2018). Where mental ill-health is stigmatised and considered a taboo. This study investigates the racial and ethnic differences between Caucasian's and South Asian's in seeking mental health treatment in Scotland with respect to stigma during COVID-19. In this study participants of both Caucasian (n=32) and South Asian (n=36) ethnicities were gathered from the student pool of the University of Glasgow and surrounding areas. Individuals were provided with online self-report questionnaires and were asked to answer multiple questions. The data obtained was then analysed through an online R server, where means and standard deviations, two-way Anova tests and Welch two sample t-tests were carried out to examine statistical differences. The results obtained showed that there was in fact differences present between the two ethnicities. South Asians participants reported back a greater level of negative attitude towards help-seeking behaviour for mental ill- health. Inconsistent with our prediction there were no differences found within the ethnic groups when comparing responses to help-seeking of individuals of different ethnicities. The results also showed that again inconsistent with our prediction Caucasians portrayed a greater level of internalised stigma that South Asians. Overall, although there were differences present between the two ethnic groups, some differences were not as predicted.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** High prevalence rates of mental health difficulties are reported in young people with learning disabilities (Learning disability statistics: mental health problems, 2020). As the well-being of children and adolescents is context dependent, schools have become a key setting when researching their student well-being (Tobia et al., 2019). Notably, adolescent girls with a disability have reported particularly low levels of well-being at school (Arciuli & Emerson, 2020). Although there is comprehensive guidance for supporting the student well-being of people with common learning disabilities, this is not inclusive of rarer conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). To fill this gap, this study aimed to explore the student well-being of adolescent girls with PWS by twinning a school day storyboard task with an informal interview, whereby participants were encouraged to share their experiences of daily school life. A thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) was carried out which established three themes: (1) a sense of belonging; (2) feeling comfortable and safe in the school environment; and (3) a desire to learn and be challenged. The findings highlighted the preferences and values of participants, as well as the crucial role members of staff play in enabling secure identity development and effective school functioning. Future research may wish to include a more diverse sample and explore the effectiveness of behavioural management interventions for PWS within schools.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Studies have suggested being religious is associated with fewer incidences of depression. Coupling this finding with the theoretical risk factor of socioemotional interpretation biases in the disorder's onset, we hypothesised that (i) there would be a negative monotonic relationship between self-reported religiosity and depression and that (ii) the combination of religiosity measures with participants' interpretation of emotion in voices would significantly predict depression scores over and above participants' levels of religiosity alone. A total of 739 participants completed the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales, the Duke University Religion Index, and categorised the perceived emotion of 140 synthetic voices as happy or sad. Although religiosity had a significant main effect on depression, $\chi$^2^(12) = 61.40, p <   .001, the relationship was not consistently negative across all levels of self-reported religiosity. Hierarchical ordinal regression models revealed the interpretation of socioemotional vocal expressions did not contribute significantly to the religiosity-only models for male voices, $\chi$^2^(1) =  .23, p = .64, or female voices, $\chi$^2^(1) = .003, p = .96. These findings together suggest the theoretical importance of negative interpretation biases in depression may be mitigated by broader belief systems, such as religion, which influence how we perceive our socioemotional world.

**Abstract:** Mental health difficulties in the transition to university may be further exacerbated by changes occurring in new undergraduate students' social network. A wealth of research indeed demonstrates the link between social ties and social support and first year students' mental health trajectories in the context of the university transition (Pittman & Richmond, 2009; Rubin et al., 2016). A novel methodology from Social Network Theory and Analysis (SNT/A) has emerged in recent years as an effective approach to investigating social environments through systematically assessing individuals' social connections and characterising their personal social networks in terms of structure, function and composition, thus offering interesting avenues to investigating the link between social ties and mental health (Valente & Pitts, 2017). In the UK, since March 2020 and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, important restrictions have been placed on social mixing and have led universities across the countries to implement a shift to online, remote, teaching, leaving new undergraduate students especially with reduced opportunities for in-person socialising and on-campus activity, the implications of which, remain largely unknown. Understanding the effects on this cohort's mental health, social networks and their interrelationship thus appears to be of crucial importance. This online survey study is an exploratory approach aimed to investigate first-year students' mental health, using a variety of outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and insomnia), their personal social networks using an egocentric network (EgoNet) approach from SNT/A and their associations as well as incorporating a qualitative component to enrich and corroborate interpretations from quantitative analyses. 61 participants (M = 19.1, SD = 3.1) were recruited from the 2020 cohort of the University of Glasgow. Results demonstrated high levels of psychological distress amongst the student in this study. Ego network analyses as well as qualitative accounts also pointed to important disruptions to the normal processes of change in social networks in the transition to university, particularly with regards to students' social integration within the university environment. Associations emerged between various characteristics of students' personal social networks and mental health outcomes across the entire sample and when living situations were considered. This study makes a contribution to the body of literature examining student mental health during the transition to university through examining its social and interpersonal context.  Implications of these findings for informing potential approaches to supporting the specific cohort of 2020 and mitigating negative outcomes in the continuation of their studies are discussed.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Meat and dairy production are among the greatest contributors to climate change. Dietary transition toward a plant-based diet might reduce environmental impact and improve the sustainability of the food industry. Although an increasing number of people in Western countries are willing to reduce meat and/or dairy consumption, further understanding of the factors influencing transition is needed. In this study we explore the process of meat and dairy reduction and transition toward a plant-based diet in a sample of Italian population. Furthermore, this study explores the role of self-control, habits, identity and social norms within this process. Thirty non-vegan Italian participants reducing meat and/or dairy for sustainability reasons completed an online qualitative survey. Three themes arouse from thematic analysis, namely conflicting motivations, the social environment and the food environment and strategies. Participants might employ self-control when they experience a conflict between incompatible drives, and in the process of new habits formation. Conviviality and lack of control over food provision might exacerbate the role of social support and social norms in dietary choice. Finally, being Italian might involve strongly rooted food traditions, which are at times incompatible with the elimination of meat and/or dairy. For this reason, participant might need to flexibly accept limited lapses allowing them to balance sustainability with traditional values.
