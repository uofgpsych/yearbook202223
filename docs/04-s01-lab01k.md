**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Previous studies have identified both circadian chronotype and social media use to be strong determinants of sleep quality; however, there is a lack of research directly investigating the relationship between the two. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to explore the association between circadian chronotype and social media use and its effect on sleep quality. For this reason, 150 university students, aged 18 to 25, completed a survey consisting of several self-report questionnaires. Circadian chronotype was measured by the Morningess-Eveningness Questionnaire. Social media use was assessed by a single-item questionnaire asking for hours per day spent on social media. Sleep quality was determined by the Sleep Condition Indicator. A multiple regression analysis revealed a significant effect of circadian chronotype on sleep quality (t = 2.75, p = .007), which implied that the Evening-type chronotype is associated with poorer sleep. Effects of social media use (t = 1.408, p = .161) and the interaction between circadian chronotype and social media use (t = -1.552, p = .123) on sleep quality were non-significant. An exploratory analysis comparing subjective estimates and objectively collected data of social media use showed a significant difference between the two (t(113) = 5.11, p < .001), suggesting that participants, on average, overestimate the time spent on social media. Our findings stress the importance of addressing the detrimental effects of the Evening-type chronotype on sleep quality in students with appropriate instruments and employing objective measures of social media use. Suggestions for future research include, but are not limited to, taking the timing of social media use into consideration and studying this association in qualitatively different samples.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** A wealth of prior research has established that speakers of nonstandard dialects are evaluated differently from speakers of standard language forms on personality and emotional expression, but research on written forms of these dialects is scarce. An exploratory between-subjects study was conducted with both Scottish and non-Scottish volunteer participants in order to explore the effect of written Scottish Dialect, as compared to Standard English, on evaluations of status, solidarity and emotional intensity. It was predicted that Scottish Dialect would be downgraded on status and solidarity relative to Standard English, subject to the effects of in-group favouritism from Scottish participants. Additionally, it was predicted that non-Scottish participants would perceive Scottish Dialect as less emotionally intense than Standard English, while Scottish participants would perceive it as more emotionally intense. Results showed that Scottish Dialect was evaluated significantly lower on status than Standard English, subject to the expected interactions, but failed to find significant main effects for solidarity and emotional intensity. These results provide support for the persistence of cultural prejudice against nonstandard dialects in written contexts, but future research is recommended to further examine the disparities between written and spoken dialect.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Insomnia is robustly associated with several psychopathologies and elevated suicide risk. The disorder is being diagnosed at increasing rates in young adult populations with corresponding drastic public health consequences as exemplified by the current oversaturation of mental health services. Despite this, a dearth of research addresses mechanisms underlying these associations. Previous literature which employs the Integrated-Motivational-Volitional Theory of Suicidal Behaviour and Social Rank Theory suggests perceptions of defeat and entrapment play an integral role in the relationships observed between both insomnia and psychopathology and insomnia and suicide, although little is known about the factors which contribute to their development. Recent research implicates loneliness as one such possible factor. This study aimed to ascertain whether loneliness mediated the relationship between insomnia and defeat and between defeat and entrapment in young adults. Young adult volunteers aged between 18 and 24 (n = 90) were recruited online and completed four self-report measures which assessed insomnia symptoms (Sleep Condition Indicator), feelings of defeat (The Defeat Scale), feelings of entrapment (The Entrapment Scale) and loneliness severity (UCLA Loneliness Scale). Simple mediation analysis indicated that loneliness fully mediates the relationship between insomnia and defeat and partially mediates the relationship between defeat and entrapment. Such findings extend theoretical knowledge, especially with regards to the IMV, and have important implications regarding therapeutic interventions. They suggest loneliness be a target of novel and existing therapies to help mitigate perceptions of defeat and entrapment and consequently, to prevent poor affective outcomes linked to an insomnia diagnosis.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** The aim of this study was to shine a much-needed light on the first had experiences of barriers and facilitators undergone by Scottish care leavers in response to drastic attrition rates despite resent policy advancements in eligibility. As a result of low sample turn out, three individuals where interviewed using vignettes intended for focus groups. The themes elicited varied largly between participants, however analysis derived five unanimous themes included pre-existing trauma, stigma, relationships, and grey areas. The underlying psychological processes to which these themes utilise to enact their roles as barriers and or facilitators are discussed. The present study concludes the constitution of barriers to aftercare support to involve a disregard for the individuality of care leavers in their traumatic experiences; stigmatisation; need for affective support; and legal variability care leavers; while facilitators act in the contrary. Resulting implications and future directions, include a need for experience lead research and a support structure that reflects individual needs rather than facilitating boreoarctic requirements of provision.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Many university students struggle with mental health difficulties. Social support is an important component of handling the stressors of an academic environment and any mental health issues. Students with mental health issues often report lower levels of social support. We developed a vignette questionnaire for measuring social support tailored to a university setting. It evaluates the willingness of students to interact with and support peers suffering from anxiety and depression. The scale is validated by comparing anxiety and depression scores to the established Generalized Anxiety Stigma Scale and the Depression Stigma Scale. 104 (M age = 21.7) participants took part in the study, of which 11 did not complete the control vignette. We found that anxiety and depression scores were significantly correlated with the established GASS and DSS according to Pearson's correlation method. A T-test showed that control scores differed significantly from the anxiety and depression scores. This suggests that peer treatment of students is correlated with peer attitudes towards mental health. We recommend this scale to be used to measure the effectiveness of a mental health initiative targeting social support.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Inconsistencies between theoretical conceptualisations and empirical findings for eating habits limit the holistic assessment and subsequent development of effective behaviour change interventions. To address these issues, the current study applied the novel Situated Assessment Method (SAM^2^) and investigated hypotheses of large individual differences, influential predictors, and implicit learning about eating motives. As part of a two-week investigation on eating and COVID-stress motives, 63 UK-based adults rated consumed food amount and its grounded predictors taste, fillingness, automaticity, healthiness, emotional satisfaction, and self-identity on 16 representative food groups. Additional ratings for the experimentally manipulated control condition COVID-stress assessed the generalisability of learning effects.  Group-level, mixed-effect regression models explained large differences for individual eating motives at all timepoints, specifically establishing the importance of automaticity and taste. Despite limited awareness about the importance of predictors, increases in associative strength suggested repetition-induced implicit learning about eating motives but less about COVID-stress motives. These results not only address issues of operationalisation but highlight the ability of repeated SAM^2^  assessments to capture eating habit profiles and induce implicit learning about underlying motives. To establish SAM^2^  as an effective tool for eating behaviour interventions, further investigations should investigate its external validity and should identify predictors of learning success.
