**Abstract:** There has recently been a shift in the research domain towards a more holistic view of adolescent's social media engagement, moving beyond screen time. However, there is a lack of adolescent perspectives informing this new approach. The current study adds to the literature by offering individualised interpretations of social media experiences and their relationship with wellbeing and sleep. Six adolescents (4 females, 2 male) aged 15-18 participated in one-one semi-structured interviews on Zoom, exploring both day and night SM habits. Interviews incorporated photo-elicitation methodology, whereby participants presented photographs of their online experiences to help prompt dialogue. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis produced four superordinate themes: "Taking Control Over Engagement", "Online Presentation: Understanding Authenticity", "Sleep Implications" and "Escapism". All themes highlight the multifaceted nature of adolescent's social media use, with many reporting both positive and negative experiences with various aspects of social media. Crucially, while the lived experiences of adolescents varied, it was evident that the most important determinants for wellbeing and sleep outcomes were underlying factors and the context in which user behaviours occurred. Collectively, analyses support the research shift away from screen time and suggest that reframing the negative narrative around teens social media use is crucial. The current findings are discussed in terms of the study's limitations, implications as well as directions for future research.
