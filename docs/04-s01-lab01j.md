**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Robots are increasingly becoming a part of modern society. To get the most benefits from robots, it is imperative to understand where people's attitudes towards robots derive from. The current study aimed to replicate and expand on Sundar et al.'s (2016) findings on the effects of media on people's anxiety and attitudes towards robots, and subsequently, the probability of getting a robot (adoption intentions). A sample of 192 participants completed a free recall task and various questionnaires assessing robots in film/television experiences (including sympathy towards robots, character types, and appearance of recalled robots), attitudes towards robots, and contact with real robots. Stepwise regression analyses found that only perceived sympathy significantly predicted attitudes towards robots; not the amount of recalled media, appearance, or character type of robots. Anxiety predicted lower levels of perceived ease of use and usefulness of robots, while negative attitudes only predicted perceived usefulness of companion robots. Perceived usefulness predicted adoption intentions of both assistant and companion robots, while ease of use only predicted adoption intentions of companion robots. The findings are discussed in relation to other studies in the area and limitations and future directions are presented.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Recently it seems that the world has gone through an increasing number of unforeseen and widely felt events. These events, dubbed Black Swan events by risk specialist N.N. Taleb, have given rise to a growing body of research dedicated towards identifying these Black Swans as early as possible and mitigating the risks they present. Some groups, however, such as individual investors within the stock trade, appear to be less affected by these risks than others. By using time series analysis of secondary data provided by an operating casino, this paper aimed to identify if this resilience towards Black Swan events also exists within a gambling population. Gamblers did appear to show some level of resilience towards these unpredictable events, leading to the suggestion that gambling itself encouraged resilience under these conditions and that frequent gamblers may be examples of antifragile personalities, best equipped to thrive in uncertain circumstances.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Children spend a considerable amount of their downtime watching television programmes. Research suggests that within these programmes, children are being exposed to a range of gender stereotypes. This present study conducts a secondary data analysis on data collected in 2018 and 2020 by Dr Paterson's lab at the University of Glasgow, to explore the differences in gender stereotypes surrounding characters' appearance in programmes watched by girls, boys and those watched by both genders using a protocol that measures characters' appearances. A one-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference in gender stereotyped appearances of characters in the programmes watched by the three groups, with characters in programmes watched by girls being more gender stereotyped. Further exploration of the appearance of lead and support characters showed there were statistically significant differences in gender stereotyped appearance of lead characters between the groups, but no significant findings were found for the support characters. From these data it was concluded that within children's programmes, gender stereotypes related to characters' appearances are very much apparent and highlights the potential negative effects such stereotypes could be having on children's development. The findings are discussed in terms of the implications that gender stereotypes could be having on children and ideas are suggested on how future research could further investigate gender stereotypes in children's television programmes.
