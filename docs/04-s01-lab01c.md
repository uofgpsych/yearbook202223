**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Research shows that behaving prosocially, i.e., for the benefit of others, not only increases the well-being of the recipient, but also of the helper. However, there is important variability in this effect and uncertainty about the conditions under which it occurs. The person-activity congruence model suggests acting in accordance with one's values enhances well-being. Accordingly, recent findings indicate that individual's orientation toward happiness, which represents the way they pursue happiness, may further the well-being boosting effect of prosociality. The present study aimed to provide further evidence of that prosocial behaviour, in particular volunteering, is associated with enhanced subjective well-being and examine the moderating effect of two types of happiness orientation on this relationship. Participants (N = 59) completed online questionnaires assessing positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, and happiness orientation and were grouped into the prosocial condition (n = 29) or control condition (n = 30) based on their self-categorisation as volunteers. Contrary to expectations, the two conditions did not differ in their levels of subjective well-being or positive affect. The present study thus found no support for the claim that prosocial behaviour, here volunteering, is associated with benefits to helpers' well-being. Moreover, because of the non-significant result it was not possible to use a regression model to establish the role of happiness orientation in this relationship. Consequently, this study could not support nor reject a person-activity congruence model of prosociality. There likely has been considerable influence of external variables such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the study's outcome, therefore the results must be interpreted with caution.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** This study examined how online engagement and non-academic influences affected perceived academic confidence and skill in 79 University of Glasgow psychology students. We measured academic online engagement, student perceived academic confidence, student perceived academic skill and non-academic influences such as sleep and exercise levels. Students who engaged in online content more and who had more of a positive association with non-academic influences experienced higher levels of perceived academic confidence. Higher levels of online engagement also predicted increased perceived academic skill levels. However, a more positive association with non-academic influences did not predict perceived academic skill levels. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that increased online engagement can significantly impact student development. In addition, our results indicate that the interconnectivity between these variables is an interesting and complex relationship. Therefore, future research in this area will be particularly valuable in order to gain a deeper understanding of how perceived academic success can be impacted by online engagement and non-academic influences and to explore the effect that this has on student development throughout their university career.

**Abstract:** Diet has been a focus of study due to the significant influence on our health, leading to an exploration of promoting healthy food choices. Health information labelling is the most widespread strategy of influencing people's choices, with identity related goals established as salient moderators. However, the effects of a popular health label that also represents a stigmatised identity - the vegan label - have been ignored. Furthermore, food choice studies have received criticism in the past for inconsistent results. This study aims to investigate the impact of the vegan label on food choice and improve upon these studies by measuring for two previously unaccounted for extraneous variables. Dietary values are measured on a 6-point Likert-scale to account for individual differences and novel methodology measured a food's presumed dietary status (vegan or not vegan). Findings from participants (N = 719) concluded that overall, the omnivorous group chose significantly more food that was presumed vegan, while the plant-based group chose significantly more food with a vegan label. However, there were various effects within all 6 dietary groups. Findings and interpretations indicate there is a more nuanced understanding to the study of food choice, while also identifying that foods presumed dietary status, vegan label and dietary status on a continuum should be measured in future food choice studies.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Productivity is a complex construct that has not been fully investigated in qualitative psychological research. Current literature on productivity focuses on behavioural output and determines how good or bad productivity is from this output. Furthermore, we have limited understanding of how productivity and well-being interact. Therefore, existing research requires further investigation into motivational processes, diverse forms of productivity, and the direct relationship between productivity and well-being. The current study, situated in a critical realist perspective, explored undergraduate students' lived experiences of high-level productivity. Research questions were designed to investigate motivational processes underlying high-level productivity; how healthy and toxic forms of high-level productivity differ; and the potential impact of high-level productivity on well-being. An online qualitative survey, created for this study, was completed by 38 participants. Data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, which produced three major themes. Theme 1, informed by Self-Determination Theory, proposed that motivation is need-based and choice-based. Theme 2 suggested that productivity is a persistent yet challenging process to maintain, and partially influenced by societal expectations to appear busy. Theme 3 identified that students prioritise productivity over well-being unless they have earned rest. These findings can inform policy and practice for institutional well-being guidelines, resources, and interventions.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** This study aims to investigate whether an online intervention is effective at improving both medical and nursing undergraduate students' attitudes toward homelessness, as measured by the Attitudes Toward Homelessness Inventory (ATHI) (Kingree & Daves, 1989). This is due to mixed findings of studies researching changes in attitudes toward homelessness after experiencing clinical rotations, and limited research into online interventions for homelessness within  healthcare  students.  It  is  hypothesised  that  the  online  intervention  will result in a significant improvement in attitudes toward homelessness for medical and nursing students, as measured by the ATHI, compared to the control group. Additionally, it is hypothesised that there will be a correlation between the year of study and the attitudes toward homelessness at Time 1. A 2x2 mixed experimental design was used to assess whether the online intervention improved attitudes  toward homelessness. A total  of 38 undergraduate medical  and nursing students  at  the  University  of  Glasgow  volunteered  to participate in  the  study. Participants provided demographic  information  and  completed  the  ATHI  (Time  1)  before being randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Both groups watched a brief video, before being provided with an infographic to read and three comprehension questions to  complete.  The  control  group received  a  video  and  an  infographic  on  climate change, whereas the experimental group received the intervention focussing on homelessness and  health.  One-week  later  participants  completed  the  ATHI  again  (Time  2)  before  being debriefed.  A  one-way ANCOVA was  carried  out  and  found  that  the  intervention  did  not significantly improve attitudes  of  medical  and  nursing  students  toward  homelessness, compared to the control group, when controlling for Time 1 ATHI scores. A correlation test found no correlation between the year group and the ATHI scores at Time 1. The limitations of this study are discussed along with the implications, and areas for future research.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Previous research based on the psychology of attraction has led to various theories being formed. A prominent theory is that of physical attraction to sexual dimorphism; men are more attracted to feminine women, and women to masculine men. Studies testing this have found heterosexual men to be more attracted to sexually dimorphic women, with variations in heterosexual women's attraction. However, such studies tend not to include non-heterosexual or non-binary gendered people. The present study aims to bridge this gap in literature to explore whether someone having a non-binary gender affects how attractive they are perceived, as well as how attractive they perceive others to be. Results found that non-binary participants rated more people as attractive, as did non-heterosexual participants. There was also a significant interaction between target gender binary and participant sexuality, implying a unique experience of attraction by this group.
