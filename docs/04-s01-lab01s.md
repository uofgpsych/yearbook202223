**Abstract:** Poverty, deprivation and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have all been strongly linked to a higher incidence of substance misuse, joining gangs, engaging in antisocial behaviours and experiencing  poor  mental  well-being  in  young  people.  An  initiative  recognized  by  recent research as having the potential to be a factor mitigating the detrimental effects of poverty and deprivation on a young person's life outcomes and trajectory is youth-led programmes. One such  programme  is  the  G20  Project  based  in  Maryhill,  one  of  the  most  deprived  areas  of Glasgow. Accordingly, this research aimed to explore Scottish young people's perception of the impact that the G20 youth project has on their mental well-being, quality of life and future outcomes. This was explored through two graffiti art sessions and focus groups. Three female participants between the ages of 16 and 18 expressed an interest in taking part in this research, met the inclusion criteria and were recruited. A reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the complied data and three main themes, each with two subthemes were generated: "Meeting Needs & Providing Support", "People Make G20", "Teaching & Diverting". The findings of this research are consistent with and add to findings of previous literature suggesting a wide ranging positive impact of youth-led programmes on the lives of young people from deprived neighbourhoods and their wider community. This research supports and has implications for the establishment of more youth-led programmes in deprived neighbourhoods and it highlights the dire need for further future research in this area.

**Abstract:** A good autism theory must capture the reality of autistic individuals. A predictive coding framework known as the high, inflexible precision of prediction errors in autism (HIPPEA) theory attempts to explain the autistic experience. Our aim was to understand to what extent the HIPPEA theory resonated with the lived experiences of autistic individuals. A combined qualitative approach was used where themes were identified deductively, based on the HIPPEA theory, and inductively to capture information grounded in participants' responses. A total of fifteen participants were recruited for this study. Two online questionnaires were developed - for autistic adults (above 18) and for the parents of autistic children (aged 12-18). Data analysis followed an iterative process, which included concordant assignment of deductive and inductive codes clustered to form provisional themes. Participants highlighted the difficulty of having fixed predictions for every situation, which could not accommodate variations. However, this was valid to different degrees between individuals with many reporting actively interacting with their environments - i.e. masking. Whereas experiences of inflexible predictions and necessity of more information to create a generalisation agreed with HIPPEA's prepositions, others like masking were not easily interpretable. Future research may conduct interviews based on the results to elaborate on the responses.

**Abstract:** Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) has been implemented as a transdiagnostic risk factor for conditions with anxiety related symptoms. In extension, IU is utilised as a theoretical framework for understanding cognitive processes that underpin autistic traits such as sensory sensitivity and insistence-on-sameness. Currently, standardised CBT interventions have low efficacy in autistic samples. IU can be targeted to develop better interventions for autistic individuals to increase tolerance of uncertainty and in effect, manage anxiety related ASD traits. Firstly, the current study investigated the relationship of IU and personality traits including self-report anxiety, sensory sensitivity, and autistic traits. IU research predominantly uses self-report measures and this field lacks behavioural measurements of trait IU. Therefore, our second analysis examined the efficacy of a computer game modelled on the works of Radell et al. (2016) to objectively measure trait IU in the general population. The data evidenced a strong significant relationship between self-report measures of IU, autistic traits, and anxiety. Contrary to our hypothesis, sensory sensitivity was not significantly related to trait IU. In addition, the computer game measurement of IU did not significantly correlate with validated self-report measures or ASD personality traits. This suggests that the computer game, in its current form, did not reliably measure trait IU and future replication studies should aim to improve behavioural IU measures. Nevertheless, there is a gap in research for novel testing of trait IU to examine the nuances of the cognitive process that underpins behavioural characteristics of autism. With the purpose of producing IU targeted interventions for long-term, effective management of autistic traits.

**Abstract:** **Introduction: **COVID-19 related stress and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) are identified as possible predictors of compliance to guidelines in young adults. Park and colleagues (2020) found that COVID-19 stress levels were high, particularly for severity and infection related stressors. Individuals who have high levels of COVID-19 infection stress may demonstrate more hygiene behaviors and caution, thereby complying to government guidelines. FOMO has been linked to various risk-taking behaviors (Riordan et al., 2019), and may be relevant for compliance to guidelines, as non-compliance may also be considered a risk-taking behavior by increasing the risk of infection and by spreading the virus.<br>**Methods & Results:** 42 first-year undergraduate students who lived in student halls in Scotland were recruited for an online study. Participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires measuring FOMO, COVID-19 stress and rate of compliance to guidelines. A multiple regression analysis, conducted to assess how well COVID-19 stress and FOMO could predict rate of compliance, indicated a non-significant model for compliance (F(2, 39) = 3.13, p = 0.06, R^2^ = 0.138). A linear regression analysis using COVID-19 stress as a predictor of rate of compliance, was run and resulted in a significant model (F(1, 40) = 6.29, p = 0.02, R^2^ = 0.136).<br>**Discussion: **This study contributes to the limited body of research related to the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated two possible predictors of compliance that had not been researched before. It provides insight into the motivations and barriers to compliance for young adults. The results have implications for student support and compliance protocols. The limitations discussed are centered around the complexity and novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>

**Abstract:** Sex  offenders  have  long  since  been  a  vulnerable  and  marginalised  group  within our society, with the success of their reintegration and desistance depending hugely on protective factors such as adequate housing, employment and stable social networks. Restorative justice initiatives have the opportunity to aid establishing those factors in and out of prison, ultimately reducing reoffending. The Norwegian criminal justice system already incorporates many of those ideas, boasting one of the lowest reoffending rates in the world, in contrast to the British criminal justice system which is more retributive in nature. It is therefore vital to understand public attitudes towards restorative justice initiatives for sex offenders and their underlying reasons in order to potentially change negative attitudes and influence behaviour. The present study explored cultural differences in attitudes towards restorative justice initiatives for sex offenders  using  focus  groups  with  British  and  Norwegian  participants.  Thematic  analysis revealed four main themes, namely Internal conflict, Otherness of sex offenders, Practical vs. humanistic  support,  and  Cautious  conditional  agreement.  No  major  differences  between British and Norwegian attitudes were found, as well as an overarching, albeit cautious, support for such initiatives. This suggests that public attitudes do not necessarily depend on existing criminal justice systems, showing potential for incorporating restorative justice initiatives for sex  offenders  into  the  British  system.  Implications  and  directions  for  future  research  are discussed, concluding that educating and informing the public about practical benefits of such initiatives is crucial for initiating attitude and social change.

**Abstract:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, students were taught online after having signed up to face-to-face teaching. This dissertation study explored how undergraduate students experienced sense of belonging during the pivot to online teaching. A qualitative approach using reflexive thematic analysis allowed for rich insight into students' experience of sense of belonging within the framework of reflexive thematic analysis, harnessing the student position of the researcher. Seventeen participants were recruited via social media and an institutional participant pool. Four semi-structured online focus groups were conducted and recorded in January 2021. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Analysis identified four themes related to students experience of a sense of belonging. Students reacted to an experience of increased isolation they felt by cultivating a stronger sense of academic belonging through personal relationships with individual staff and students. They relied on these groups to take on responsibilities where they perceived the university as an institution to fail in supporting their peers which they identified as reasons for feeling alienated. Students' experience of sense of belonging was similar to earlier research but experienced more acutely through changing relationships due to the lack of in-person interaction on campus. The importance of opportunities for interaction with peers and staff should be considered in the pivot back to traditional teaching.

**Abstract:** Despite identifying themselves as active participants in the foster family unit, the contributions of birth children of foster carers to the foster family have been consistently neglected in research and policy. The literature that does exist on birth children of foster carers often focuses on them with the purpose of improving the outcomes of the foster child, not the birth child themselves. This study aims to explore how birth children of foster carers make sense of being in a foster family through story completion, a recently developed and promising qualitative methodology. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted on 34 story completion texts from 17 UK based birth children of foster carers, aged 8-49 years. Three themes were identified: costs, family identity, and empathy. These themes further current research by refining the key markers of birth children's experience and highlighting the strategies employed by birth children to make sense of their experience. Participants showed an aptitude for positively resolving the more negative aspects of fostering, which supports literature attributing birth children of foster carers' resilience to their secure attachment. Additional implications of findings are discussed, concluding that birth children of foster carers should be more widely recognised for their role in the foster family unit, better supported through it, and more officially involved in the decisions and processes of fostering.

**Abstract:** Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterised by biased perception of biological motion (i.e., human movement). Considering that gestures, a subtype of biological motion, are particularly important for communication, this study investigated the neural correlates of gesture perception in MDD. We expected different neural activity between individuals with MDD and healthy individuals when viewing negatively or positively valenced instrumental and expressive gestures, potentially manifesting in brain areas associated with gesture perception, including superior temporal, frontal and emotion processing regions. This was examined using an unpublished functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset that contained data from 12 participants with MDD and 12 control participants who were scanned while viewing displays of point-light gestures. The results of a random effects three-way mixed ANOVA indicated that individuals with MDD had greater activity in the right claustrum compared to healthy individuals, regardless of gesture type or valence. This could reflect a greater effort to associate sensory, motor and limbic information, or it could reflect altered attention during gesture perception in MDD. Replications with larger samples are encouraged to extend these initial findings to enhance an understanding of how gesture perception is affected in MDD in order to inform assessment and treatment.

**Abstract:** The present study examined the relationship between the life satisfaction, belief in generic conspiracies and trust in science and scientists. A sample of 203 participants aged 18-45 years (M = 23.5, SD = 4.95) completed the three scales Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Generic Conspiracists Beliefs Scale (GCBS), and Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory (TISSI) in an online study. No significant relationships were observed between SWLS and GCBS, nor between SLWS and TISSI. The hypothesis that higher life satisfaction would be related to greater trust in science and a lower rate of endorsement of conspiracy theories was not supported. An exploratory correlation found a moderate negative relationship between scores on GCBS and TISSI, suggesting that higher belief in conspiracies is linked to lower trust in science. Gender differences were examined using linear models and the only significant difference, yet underpowered, was found on SWLS in participants who did not identify as female nor male. Other linear model analyses did not report significant findings on GCBS nor on TISSI. Higher age was weakly positively correlated with SWLS and TISSI, and weakly negatively correlated with GCBS. Limitations and implications are discussed.

**Abstract:** **Introduction: **Intolerance of Uncertainty (IoU) has been positively associated with and potentially moderates Anxiety and autistic traits in clinical Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) populations. However, some limited research has found the strength of this relationship to be equivalent in neurotypical populations. Autistic traits also exist on a continuum within general population, and as such it stands to reason that both IoU and autistic traits will also influence their levels of anxiety.<br>
**Methods: **Recruited participants completed an online study consisting of a series of questionnaires measuring IoU (IUS-12), Autistic Traits (AQ-10) and Anxiety (GAD-7).<br>
**Results: **The data from 96 participants was included in the study (Mean age = 28.8 years, SD age =14.5 years; 68.8% female, 27.1% male, 3.1% non-binary, 1% preferred not to say). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis determined that IoU significantly predicted anxiety (F(1, 94) = 58.53, p < .001, adjusted R^2^ = .377), and that the addition of autistic traits did not significantly increase the variance explained ($\Delta$R2 = .370, p < .001), nor the model fit (F(2, 93) = 28.97, p <.001, F change = .015, p = .898.  This was corroborated in between-subjects t-tests which found no significant difference between high and low scoring AQ groups on either the IUS-12 or GAD-7.<br>
**Discussion: **This study highlights the importance of IoU to the development and maintenance of anxiety in the general population. We crucially investigated two possible predictors of anxiety which have previously been explored extensively in ASD populations but neglected within the general population. Implications of this research include the possible targeting of IoU in anxiety treatments for use in the wider general population as well as autistic individuals.

**Abstract:** **Introduction: **Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, most organisations throughout the world have implemented a work from home policy in order to abide social distancing restrictions. For many organisations this has meant that the workforce has moved to a completely virtual working environment.<br>
**Aim: **The aim of this study is to collect rich, qualitative data in order to explore the opinions of senior leaders regarding their experiences of a year of virtual teamwork during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
**Method: **This explorative study involves five participants from the senior leadership team of one of the largest multinational beverage companies in the world. One-on-one interviews were held over a Microsoft Teams video call with each participant in order to ascertain their current opinions of virtual teamwork. The data was then analysed using a thematic analysis technique.<br> 
**Results: **Seven core themes were found most applicable to the research question. They were explored and supported using interview extracts. The themes were Trust Formation, Engagement, Virtual Etiquette, Working from Home and Wellbeing, Casual Networking, Employee Awareness and finally Permanent Change to the Workplace.<br>

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** **Background: **Sleep issues are alarmingly prevalent in university students - in which insomnia or inadequate sleep quality can have hugely detrimental effects on students' mental health. Regarding the accessibility concerns surrounding face-to-face therapies, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a robust assessment of the effectiveness of online sleep interventions in improving students' sleep is warranted.<br>
**Methods: **Five databases were searched from inception to December 2020 - in which eight studies met eligibility criteria pertaining to the main categories: students, insomnia, and online interventions. Two independent reviewers completed the screening, data extraction, and risk of bias processes. Additionally, this systematic review was pre-registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020214026).<br>
**Results: **The eight included studies represented data from 4720 students with varied severity of insomnia symptoms or poor sleep quality. Three included studies were quasi-experimental in design. Most interventions were based on at least one component of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Across the studies, outcome effects were largest within the comprehensive online CBT-I interventions.<br>
**Conclusion: **Our findings, in line with previous literature, validates online CBT-I as effective for improving sleep in students. Future studies, however, should explore the effects of such interventions across diverse samples, study designs, delivery methods, and intervention types. Fundamentally, whilst this review demonstrates the progress made regarding online support mechanisms, our findings highlight the advancements still to be made for developing accessible services for students.
