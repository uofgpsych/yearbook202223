**Abstract:** **Objectives: **Autistic people are more likely to have unfulfilled healthcare needs. One strategy suggested is to improve autism training and awareness in undergraduate healthcare professionals. This study aimed to investigate autism awareness in medicine, nursing, and dentistry students in the UK.<br>
**Design: **Through a convergent parallel mixed methods design, quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis were conducted simultaneously.<br>
**Methods: **One hundred and thirty-three participants completed an adapted version of the Autism Knowledge and Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, then answered open-ended questions surrounding their knowledge of autistic patients.<br>
**Results: **Participants possessed good autism knowledge scores, with no significant difference in knowledge between degrees. However, nursing students had significantly higher self-efficacy than medical students. Only personal experience was a significant predictor of autism knowledge, however both personal and previous experience significantly predicted clinical self-efficacy. Qualitative analysis complemented these findings, elaborating on participants' autism knowledge and incorporating views on how autism is taught in their respective courses.<br>
**Conclusions: **Healthcare students displayed good autism knowledge yet identified a need for improved autism teaching. Beyond basic inclusion, the qualitative results suggest incorporating the diverse profiles of autistic people and modifying communication skill teachings. However, the findings equally point towards the role of systemic challenges in autistic people's care.

**Abstract:** **Background: **Studies suggest that the average adolescent doesn't get enough sleep, particularly during the week when other commitments such as school require them to wake up early. Use of electronics at bedtime, and social media especially, has been identified as a major barrier towards adolescent sleep in a number of qualitative studies.<br>**Aim: **To synthesise qualitative evidence of adolescent perspectives of bedtime social media.<br>**Design: **A qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis following Thomas & Harden's (2008) framework.<br>**Data sources: **MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched until November 2020. Studies were subject to a strict inclusion/exclusion policy.<br>**Results: **14 studies were included, encompassing 967 participants. Three analytical themes were developed: 1) social motivations; 2) habitual smartphone use and 3) recognition of a problem.<br>**Conclusions: **Findings confirmed how bedtime social media use fits into a new framework for peer relations, where increased frequency and immediacy of communication lays the foundation for social accountability to meet communicative norms and a fear of missing out (FoMO). Adolescents commonly express a lack of control in relation to their social media use which triggered discussion of the addictive aspects of bedtime social media use in relation to the framework. The importance of intervention strategies to strike the right balance between high quality sleep whilst recognising the wider peer-to-peer social implications of bedtime social media use was also discussed.

**Abstract:** With a growing emphasis on preventative action for mental health difficulties in childhood and adolescence, calls have been made to consider organised sport a protective social environment for facilitating positive mental health and wellbeing in young people. However, existing research in this area is lacking in giving young people a voice to share their own perspectives and experiences of participation in youth sport and mental wellbeing. This study aimed to explore young athletes perspectives on the potential relationship between organised sport participation and mental wellbeing. Six young athletes aged 11 to 13 participated in an online focus group discussing their perspectives of organised youth sport and mental wellbeing. Thematic analysis was applied to the data, resulting in four main themes: mental wellbeing indicators and sport, sport competition as a risk to mental wellbeing, sport as an influential social environment, and accessibility as a barrier to promoting mental wellbeing through sport. From listening to the perspectives of young athletes, this study suggests sport could be a potentially effective environment to facilitate positive mental wellbeing in young people. However, further research and amendments to practice should be carried out to maximise the benefits and minimise the risk of organised youth sport.

**Abstract:** **Objectives: **This study investigated whether carers working in a nursing home were more fatigued than the general population, using a consolidation of fatigue assessment scales that were also investigated for reliability. Another aim of the study was to explore whether these formal carers were at risk of developing compassion fatigue during this current coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, this was investigated using qualitative methods.<br>
**Participants: **Participants for the quantitative study (n=232) were from the general population (age 18-80). Participants for the qualitative study (n=5) were carers working in a care home, all of which were female (age= 20-37). <br>
**Study Method: **In the quantitative study we combined six fatigue questionnaires to create a 72- item questionnaire. The questionnaire took approximately 20 minutes to complete and also included several demographic questions. The qualitative study was carried out using semi- structured interviews lasting around 20 minutes.<br>
**Findings: **The quantitative study did not find any significant differences between carers and non-carers in reported levels of physical fatigue, sustained fatigue, sleepiness, and mental fatigue. This did not support the initial hypothesis. On the other hand, findings from the qualitative study indicated that carers were at risk of developing compassion fatigue. Five themes were identified: an inability to disengage from the caring role; personal protective equipment (PPE) as a barrier to communication; being "forgotten on the frontline"; a need for debrief and impact on daily life.<br>
**Conclusions: ** Overall, it appeared that although carers do not report higher levels of fatigue than the rest of the population, they may be at risk of developing compassion fatigue. To stop the adverse consequences that compassion fatigue can have on both the wellbeing of the staff and the quality of care given to residents, managements, communities, and governments need to work together to support and protect workers. Limitations and future research are discussed.

**Abstract:** The removal of body hair is normative in Western society. Research into this area has shown consistently high proportions of samples of both men and women removing some or all of their body hair. This has led to the construction of several beauty norms, such as women being expected to be hairless. Over recent years, there have been several social changes which may have impacted how individuals view their body hair and influenced their removal practices. In this project, I used a thematic analysis to examine the responses of 12 individuals who took part in two focus groups discussing their attitudes towards body hair. Three main themes were identified: Body Hair as a Tool for Identity Construction, Body Hair as Negative and The Role of the 'Other'. Overwhelmingly, female hairlessness and male hairiness was still conceptualised as the standard, however several positive changes were thought to have been made. The results are discussed in regard to their wider social implications, with directions for future research suggested.

**Abstract:** Research has shown that belonging is fundamental in both in-person and online learning (Peacock et al., 2020). However, previous studies are limited to students who chose to learn online. The current research aims to investigate the effect of the involuntary emergency remote teaching (ERT), which has been forced upon students by government restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acknowledging the novelty of the new academic environment, this project aimed to explore first-year students' experiences of belonging and how this has been affected by the emergency response to COVID-19. Secondary to this the project sought to investigate the impact of belonging and ERT on student wellbeing. Fifteen individuals who started university in September 2020 took part in online interviews. Following transcription of the audio recordings, a reflexive thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2019) was applied to the data, identifying four overarching themes for the primary research question: social media, living in student accommodation, physically visiting campus and personality. For the secondary research question two themes were identified: mental health/wellbeing and motivation. The current findings lend support to previous literature which suggests that enhancing students' sense of belonging can contribute to a healthy student life and academic success. The implications of the findings and considerations of the methodology are discussed.

**Abstract:** As a result of COVID-19, students are facing potential social isolation and disengagement from their wider university community. Research has shown that students' sense of belonging is a salient contributor to academic success and overall well-being, especially for first-year students, and that engagement in sport at university is one way through which this connection is fostered. This study aims to explore the extent to which students engage in online fitness classes, and whether this engagement is related to their sense of belonging at university. Through an online questionnaire, participants answered questions regarding their involvement in extra- and co-curricular activities and COVID-19 anxiety, and responded to a series of subscales assessing their feelings of belongingness within their university. Those who participated in sport completed an additional scale measuring their belongingness within their sporting community. Despite the constraints of the sample, correlation and multiple linear regression analyses suggested an association between perceived belonging in sport and overall belonging at university - in particular, students' feelings of affiliation to their university. There was a further association between belonging in sport and engagement in co-curricular activities. Findings are discussed in relation to the limitations of the sample and the research design. Further research is proposed that replicates this study with a more representative sample size to develop these exploratory findings, with a call to identify and refine specific variables that predict greater belonging at university through sport.

**Abstract:** **Introduction: **Minority stress theory states that minority groups experience distal (external) and proximal (internal) stressors specific to their minority identification. However, the model has been criticised for not discussing resilience, while research has failed to comparatively assess stress and resilience in different minority groups. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether perceived discrimination, social support, and identity pride (three commonly investigated protective factors against stress) are equally effective in protecting against minority stress in ethnic and sexual minority groups. <br>
**Methods: **52 ethnic minority participants and 55 sexual minority participants completed an adapted version of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (AMEIM), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Perceived Discrimination Scale (PDS), and the International Positive Affect, Negative Affect Scale - Short Form (I-PANAS-SF). Six simple linear regression models were produced assessing the significance of each factor as a predictor of emotional affect in each regression, and three were calculated to identify the interaction effect between predictor and minority condition to calculate the difference in effectiveness of each factor in each condition. <br>
**Results: **Perceived discrimination was a significant negative predictor of emotional affect in each condition (F(1, 50) = 21.45, p<.000, and an R^2^ of .300 for the ethnic minority condition and F(1, 53) = 7.96, p<.05, and an R^2^ of .131 for the sexual minority condition) as were the results for identity pride (F(1, 50) = 8.472, p<.01, and an R^2^ of .145 for the ethnic minority condition and F(1, 53) = 16.13, p<.001, and an R^2^ of .233 for the sexual minority condition). Social support was only significant for the sexual minority condition (F(1, 50) = 3.094, p =.085, and an R^2^ of .059 for the ethnic minority condition and F(1, 53) = 12.41, p <.001, and an R^2^ of .190 for the sexual minority condition). The interaction effects for each predictor were non-significant (Perceived discrimination was -9.705 (p=.307), social support was -8.278 (p=.246), and identity pride was -8.115 (p=.231)).<br> 
**Discussion: **Consistent with previous research, each protective factor was a significant predictor of emotional affect, excluding social support in the ethnic minority condition. However, no interaction effect was significant, resulting in the acceptance of the second null hypothesis. These findings suggest that the minority stress model can be applied to resilience against minority stress, resulting in greater practical application of theory to therapeutic and social practice. Similar research taking an intersectional approach would benefit current understandings of minority stress as well as more comparative literature to determine the validity of the interaction effects obtained in this study. <br>

**Abstract:** A growing body of research has established a relationship between severity of depressive symptoms and the interpretation of ambiguous scenarios, images and sentences. What is less well researched are the factors that may mediate this relationship. The current study aimed to assess the role of biological sex on the relationship between depressive symptoms and interpretation bias in an ambiguous sentence task. One hundred and forty-seven participants completed online measures assessing depressive symptoms and interpretation bias. A moderate positive correlation (r = .59) was found between depressive symptoms and interpretation bias in the current sample, and a multiple linear regression model revealed that sex did not have a significant mediating role in this relationship. It may therefore be concluded that, in the current sample, sex did not play a significant mediating role in the relationship between depressive symptoms and negative interpretations. Principally, the findings from the current study indicate that further research is required to identify the key variables that may mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and interpretation bias. Specific limitations and contributions of the current study to the overall field of research are also discussed.

**Abstract:** Research has shown that young adults' mental wellbeing has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to date, little analysis has been conducted to investigate preventative factors. There is already extensive research evidence of the positive effects of sleep and exercise on mental and physical benefits wellbeing. These include psychological resilience, which is vital in the current climate. This study investigated the effects of sleep quality and exercise levels on the perceived resilience of 92 young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A quantitative approach was used, and participants completed an online survey detailing their sleep and exercise habits before and during the initial UK lockdown of March- July 2020. All participants were aged 18-24 years and were required to have lived in the UK during the initial lockdown. The results indicated that sleep quality and exercise levels before lockdown predicted participants' perceived resilience during lockdown. Sleep quality during lockdown was also a predictor of perceived resilience at that time, whereas exercise during lockdown was not. These findings can be used to inform and educate both professionals and young people about the importance of establishing and maintaining adequate sleep quality and exercise levels, and the benefits that this can have on their future psychological resilience.

**Abstract:** The perinatal period is a time when women are at greater risk of developing a mental illness, which has serious effects on both the mother's health and baby's development. Through screening questions, and providing care during pregnancy and the antenatal period, midwives are important sources of knowledge and support for women at risk of developing perinatal mental illness. However, qualified midwives have reported a lack of confidence and knowledge relating to perinatal mental health, and student midwives lack the appropriate focus on the topic during their training. Through a survey design, this study aimed to understand Scottish final-year midwifery students' knowledge and confidence relating to perinatal mental health. The results suggest further education and new training methods dedicated to the topic are necessary in universities and greater support for students is needed when on placement.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Although attitudes towards autism have improved in recent years, non-autistic people often still hold negative views of autistic people. Consequently, autistic individuals are stigmatised and discriminated against. This contributes to self-stigma amongst autistic people as well as a host of personal, educational, and professional challenges. Previous findings indicated heightened stigma levels towards disruptive autistic behaviours; a claim corroborated by autistic people themselves. Yet, there is little understanding of contributing factors to stigmatisation of autistic behaviours. In particular, the role of knowledge of autism is still debated. It is unclear whether higher knowledge of the condition is directly linked to lower stigma, or if both knowledge and stigma are strongly linked to exposure as a third variable. This study aimed to examine whether participants expressed higher levels of stigma towards autistic behaviours with repetitive motor movement compared to autistic behaviours without repetitive motor movement. Secondly, we aimed to examine if higher knowledge was related to lower levels of stigma. We gathered data from 99 participants, presenting them with three vignettes - displaying autistic behaviours without stimming, autistic behaviours with stimming and a control - immediately followed by a short social distance scale and, finally the ASKSG (McClain et al., 2019) to assess knowledge. Results indicated that self-reported stigma was significantly higher for both autistic conditions compared to a control but no significant difference in explicit stigma was found between them. There was no significant relationship between knowledge and expressed stigma. Consequently, there is still a need to address stigmatisation of autistic behaviours. However, the most common interventions aiming to decrease stigma towards autism rely on increasing knowledge. These findings suggest that knowledge has little bearing on stigma levels; so, interventions based on increasing knowledge may not be the most effective.

**Abstract:** This study investigated the prevalence and dimensionality of fatigue in different cultural populations through the development of a new fatigue questionnaire comprising of multiple fatigue scale. Through incorporating qualitative means, this study also aimed to assess the experience and ideologies supporting fatigue in European and Caribbean cultures. The quantitative element of this study combined 6 questionnaires to form a 72-item battery to assess the general population. The qualitative study implemented a semi-structured interview lasting roughly 45 minutes to capture the personal experience of a diverse group of people from Caribbean and European cultural backgrounds. Results from the quantitative study revealed no significant differences between the cultural subgroups, Europe and Americas, however the qualitative analysis highlighted that fatigue was a culture specific symptom, whereby culture affected in representation and interpretation. Through thematic analysis, three themes were identified: Dimensionality of Fatigue, Contextual experience of fatigue and Cultural ideologies. These findings should inform interventions and future studies to revise the generalisability of fatigue constructs and definition to adopt a culture outlook on health symptomologies, specifically fatigue.

**Abstract:** Emoji are a nuanced and communicative tool that serve to enrich text-based interactions by substituting non-verbal behaviours. The purpose of this study is to investigate how emojis are used and interpreted in digitally-mediated conversation, and whether people with autistic or social anxiety traits might use and interpret them differently. Adopting a within-subject design, this study presented participants with text message-emoji pairings under various congruency conditions in which they were asked to rate the text message on its believability and perceived mood, with an additional measurement of response time. Appropriate questionnaires indicated participants with high autistic and social anxiety traits. The results showed support for the preliminary hypotheses as there was increased ambiguity in response to the believability and perceived mood of the incongruent emoji-text and longer response times, compared to the congruent pairings. However, participants with autistic and social anxiety traits were not found to show significant differences in response time, perception of mood and believability. By exploring differences in emoji usage and how they facilitate text-message interactions, there is potential to understand how emoji may benefit individuals in a clinical setting and further cultivate meaningful experience in text-based communication.

**Abstract:** In a wide range of situations, decision-makers need to negotiate between the competing demands of response speed and response accuracy. This dilemma is known as the speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT). The current study's focus was to replicate SAT effects. Based on existing literature on SAT, two hypotheses were drawn. The first one predicted that subjects would be faster in Speed conditions as well as faster for higher levels of evidence. The second hypothesis predicted that participants will be more accurate in the Accuracy instructions, in addition to higher levels of coherency. When external feedback is absent, perceptual decisions are accompanied by feelings of confidence that reflect the likelihood of the decision being correct. This study further investigated mean confidence differences between Speed and Accuracy instructions, outlining two more hypotheses. Mean confidence ratings from Speed instruction were expected to be lower than that of the Accuracy, yet with greater variability. These predictions were based on literature investigating metacognitive evaluations, considering pre- and post- decisional processes. To compute analyses, secondary data from 19 participants from an unpublished study was used. Results using a 2x3 ANOVA for the replication of SAT were significant, as subjects were quicker under Speed rather than Accuracy condition, and more accurate in Accuracy rather than Speed condition. Findings from confidence judgements unravelled a series of insignificant outcomes. To comprehend confidence ratings from Speed and Accuracy conditions, shift function was applied. Despite results of shift function being insignificant, interesting trends are identified and further discussed.

**Abstract:** Conspiracy theories have been spreading relentlessly throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Research has shown how conspiracy beliefs can reduce a number of prosocial and health behaviours whilst also increasing prejudicial attitudes and violent intentions from only a single exposure. Nudging, the psychologically based intervention strategy, offers a potential opportunity to attend to growing concerns regarding conspiracies. This study experimentally investigated the effect of an intervention nudge supporting or debunking the popular 5G conspiracy in the UK on predicted prosocial behaviour. Further regression analysis investigated the associations between prosocial behaviour predictions and vaccination intentions with various predictor variables. 102 participants from a mixed sample of students and the general public were randomly assigned into two groups and completed a questionnaire which included measures of psychopathy, conspiracy mentality, past and predicted prosocial behaviour and vaccination intentions. Results indicated no significant difference in prosocial forecasting between the two groups. However, from the predictive models it could be suggested that there may be an anti-conspiracy effect related to the exposure of a conspiracy support extract. The implications of these results are discussed relative to the context of the unique fact-checking and scrutinising environments in the UK and worldwide throughout the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of nudging in the efforts to reduce the negative consequences of conspiracy theories.

**Abstract:** Research has found that post-migration stressors largely contribute to poor mental health outcomes in people seeking asylum (Solberg et al., 2020). In particular, policies such as no right to work and No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) push already vulnerable populations further into precarity (Dudhia, 2020). This has a distinct effect on migrant womxn with NRPF who are at increased risk of facing disbelief, destitution, detention and deportation (McIlwaine et al., 2019). This study used collage-making to explore the impact of the NRPF policy on the mental health of womxn seeking asylum in Glasgow. Carrying out a thematic analysis, three themes were determined; "My inner self is broken", "Waiting just kills" and "Dark stormy fairytale". The findings of this study highlight how the asylum process infringes upon people's identities, their sense of control over the future as well as belongingness to Scotland. Social support emerged as a critical tool to tackle some of the mental health concerns that prevail as a direct result of the post-migration environment (Salway et al., 2020).

**Abstract:** Covid-19 lockdown is a novel factor influencing physical activity levels. Physical activity levels and exercise adherence have previously been consistently positively associated with intrinsic exercise motivation, intrinsic exercise behavioural regulation, and the personality dimensions of extraversion and conscientiousness, but consistently negatively associated with neuroticism. Length of participation in primary mode of physical activity shows a possible bidirectional relationship with intrinsic exercise motivation and regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether individual differences in personality, exercise motivation, exercise behavioural regulation, and length of participation in primary mode of physical activity are reliable predictors of physical activity levels both pre and during Covid-19 lockdown for young adults aged 18-30 years old (N = 85). Recreational physical activity levels were measured by two modified versions of the Recreational Subscale of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Personality was measured by the Big Five Inventory, exercise motivation by the Exercise Motivations Inventory-2, exercise behavioural regulation by the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3, and length of participation in primary mode of physical activity pre Covid-19 lockdown by single questions. Retrospective self-report of recreational physical activity levels revealed a heterogenous change in physical activity levels during Covid-19 lockdown (47.06% decreased, 3.56% did not change, 49.41% increased). Linear mixed effects multiple regression models revealed that Covid-19 lockdown did not significantly influence the relationships between recreational physical activity levels and any individual difference measure. The predictions for a significant positive association between recreational physical activity levels and extraversion and conscientiousness were not supported. The prediction for a significant negative association between recreational physical activity and neuroticism was also not supported. However, there was a significant positive association between recreational physical activity levels and agreeableness (df = 85, t = 2.665, p <.01). The predictions were supported for a significant positive association between recreational physical activity levels and length of participation in primary mode of physical activity (df = 85, t = 4.326, p <.001), intrinsic exercise motivation (df = 85, t = 2.232, p <.05), and intrinsic exercise behavioural regulation (df = 85, t = 2.515, p <.05). Calculation of effect size parameters revealed medium effect sizes for agreeableness (0.43), intrinsic regulation (0.42), and intrinsic motivation (0.33), and a weak effect size for length of participation (0.01) on recreational physical activity levels. These findings add to the literature on the reliability of intrinsic exercise motivation and intrinsic exercise behavioural regulation as consistent predictors of physical activity, and to the novel literature on factors affecting physical activity during Covid-19 lockdown.

**Abstract:** **OBJECTIVES: **The relationship between anxiety and cognition is a complex one but it is widely accepted that anxiety results in a deficit in cognitive functioning. However, this assumption is based upon experiments which use cognitive tasks lacking ecological validity and utilise participation from the adult population who may be subjected to normal age-related cognitive decline. An empirical evaluation into the effects of anxiety on the cognitive functioning of students, who are mostly not subject to normal age-related cognitive decline but are a population with extremely high levels of anxiety, has not been conducted. This study aimed to address this gap by investigating the effects of anxiety on memory and attention in students. It was hypothesized that higher anxiety scores would correlate with and predict poorer cognitive functioning.<br>
**PARTICIPANTS: **141 participants completed the study. Participants were all students at UK universities, whose first language was English. Participants with the diversities of colour blindness and dyslexia were asked not to participate in this research.<br>
**STUDY METHOD: **A correlational design was used. An online version of the DASS-42 was used to obtain each participant's anxiety score, the outcome measure for the anxiety variable. Following completion of this, participants attended a virtual session where they completed the Stroop task to measure attention performance and a picture and word association task to measure memory performance. An interference (IG) score was calculated for the Stroop task and the time taken to complete the picture and word association task was recorded. IG score and time were the outcome measures for the cognitive variables.<br>
**FINDINGS: **Anxiety had a significant negative correlation with performance on the memory task (r = 0.68, df = 139, p < 0.01) and was a significant predictor of time taken to complete it (F(1, 139) = 118.7, p = 2.2x10-16, R^2^ = 0.4607, R^2^-adjusted = 0.4568). However, anxiety did not significantly correlate with or predict performance on the attention task. The results provided partial support for the hypothesis. <br>
**CONCLUSIONS: **These results suggested that students may face significant deficits in cognitions, particularly in the memory domain. This likely affects their academic performance. During the pandemic, anxiety levels are higher and thus it should be recommended that universities provide support for all students undertaking assessments. Future research should investigate how the cognitive deficits students with high levels of anxiety face could be managed and how effective such strategies are.

**Abstract:** Group identification can be defined as a subjective sense of belonging to one's social group, coupled with a subjective sense of commonality with group members. Group identification plays an important role in protecting and increasing wellbeing. Social and communicative challenges experienced by individuals with higher autistic traits can impact their ability to identify with groups and the absence of such connections can have negative impacts on subjective wellbeing. This study investigated the relationship between group identification, autistic traits, and subjective wellbeing. It was hypothesised that both total group identification and autistic traits would predict depression and also that both total group identification and autistic traits would predict satisfaction with life. 135 (112 females, 23 males) participants from the general population completed measures in group identification, autistic traits, depression, and satisfaction with life, as well as control variables (age and gender). Results from two hierarchical regressions revealed that both hypotheses were supported as both total group identification and autistic traits were found to significantly predict satisfaction with life and depression. Discussions include the implications of group identification in promoting positive subjective wellbeing outcomes, including applications for group based interventions that promote and encourage group identification. Limitations and considerations including potential impacts of COVID-19 on the study are also discussed with reference to uncertainty and isolation as a result of lockdown and other restrictions.
