Sadly we can't celebrate together on campus but we are delighted you came to today's celebrations. Part of the graduation ceremony is hearing Niamh read out your name as you walk up to the Principal. Since we can't be together in the Bute Hall to hear your names, we thought we would bring this part of the ceremony to you. **Please note, due to GDPR this is for private use only and should not be shared on social media.**
