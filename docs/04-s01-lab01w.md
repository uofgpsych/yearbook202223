**Abstract:** **Background: **Mental health disorders are highly prevalent in offender populations, occurring 4.5-5 times more than the general population. One possible explanation is the deinstituitionalisation of state psychiatric care which led to the criminalisation of individuals with severe mental illness. As a result, negative attitudes and stigmatisation are seen towards offenders with mental illness by the general public. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between stigmatising attitudes, trait empathy and mental illness symptomatology as well as whether certain mental illnesses were more stigmatised than others.<br>
**Method: **A within-subjects correlational design was used. Attitudes towards offenders with mental illness were measured using the Public Attitudes Towards Offenders with Mental Illness scale (PATOMI; developed by Walkden et al., 2020). Empathy was measured using the Brief Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Three vignettes, portraying three mental health disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) were used to investigate stigmatising attitudes across mental health symptomatology.<br>
**Results: **107 participants' data was analysed using a Spearman rank correlation to investigate the relationship between the variables. A moderate positive significant correlation was found between levels of empathy and PATOMI scores (r~s~ = 0.34, p = <.001). BPD was shown to be the most stigmatised vignette in comparison to schizophrenia (p = .008) and bipolar disorder (p <.001).<br>
**Conclusion: **As levels of empathy rose, less stigmatising attitudes towards mentally ill offenders were seen. BPD was revealed to be the most stigmatised vignette, indicating a need for further public education and interventions.

**Abstract:** Research investigating prejudice has demonstrated how different personality traits can predispose and lead to prejudicial social and political attitudes. More recently, the dual process motivational (DPM) model of prejudice which emphasises the mediating role of political personality traits, specifically right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), on the association between different classes of personality traits and prejudice, has been widely supported. The most recent research in the field has specifically focused on the interplay between dark personality traits, collective narcissism, political personality traits, and prejudice. This study built upon and extended research in the area to integrate the Dark Tetrad of personality traits into the DPM model to investigate prejudice towards refugees. Mediation analysis found significant mediation effects of RWA and SDO on the relationship between prejudice, collective narcissism and the Dark Core, however, results from confirmatory factor analysis did not support the predicted latent variables of the Dark Core, collective narcissism, and prejudice. Findings are discussed in terms of support for the DPM model and directions for future research.

**Abstract:** **Objective: **Low socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to diminished health outcomes, reduced psychological wellbeing and dehumanisation. Meta-dehumanisation occurs when a person believes they are being perceived as less than fully human. Research indicates that meta-dehumanisation is potentially an important factor in the connection between SES and psychological wellbeing. This study aims to further explore the relationship between meta-dehumanisation, SSS and psychological wellbeing.<br>**Method: **Data from a cross-sectional sample of 123 student participants from the University of Glasgow was collected via an online questionnaire. SSS was determined using the 10-step community focused MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status. Meta-dehumanisation was determined using an adapted version of the 8-item dehumanisation scale by Bastian et al. (2012) and psychological wellbeing was determined using the 42-item scale by Ryff and Keyes (1995).<br>**Results: **Overall, SSS and meta-dehumanisation together explained over a third of the variance in psychological wellbeing (adj. R^2^=.3463, p<0.001). Psychological wellbeing variance was also well explained individually by both SSS (R^2^=.1396, p<0.001) and meta-dehumanisation (R^2^=.2897, p<0.001). Meta-dehumanisation explained over half of the variance in the SSS and psychological wellbeing relationship.<br>**Conclusions: **The results indicate a significant relationship between SSS, meta-dehumanisation and psychological wellbeing. While further research is needed, these findings have implications for our understanding of the SSS wellbeing relationship and could help improve mental health support for people of lower-SSS.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** The voice contains a lot of socially relevant information allowing individuals to form first impressions of others. Research on the voice has vastly focused on establishing how the impression of the voice informs and influences the perception and judgments about the personality of the speaker. Less attention has been placed on how the personality of the listeners affects their perception of the speaker's personality from the voice. The current study aimed to fill the gap in the research and examined this relationship. A negative correlation was hypothesised between the socially-oriented extraversion trait of the listeners and their perception of vocal trustworthiness. Thirty-one undergraduate participants completed an online experiment consisting of a voice discrimination task, where they judged the presented morphed voice stimuli as either more trustworthy or less trustworthy, and of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality questionnaire. The correlational analysis looked at the relationship between the participants' averaged responses to the voice discrimination task, indicated by the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE), and their averaged scores to the extraversion items from the BFI. The results indicated a non-significant relationship between these two variables. The findings are discussed along with the existing literature on the socially oriented nature of individuals high in extraversion and the relationship extraversion has with the perception of socially relevant stimuli. The limitations of the current study and potential directions for future research are also discussed.

**Abstract:** Hemispheric specialisation is associated with behavioural biases, some with clinical relevance. A neurotypical right hemispheric dominance for visuospatial attention explains the slight leftward spatial bias that exists in a healthy population. This bias is known as pseudoneglect. Hemispheric dysfunctionality, as observed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), on the other hand, has been theorised to lead to a deviation from typical pseudoneglect, characterised by either a reduction in leftward bias, or an inverted rightward bias. A body of literature has developed which aims to characterise this bias in ADHD, but studies report mixed results with biases of varying laterality and magnitude. Here, I have performed a meta-analysis to determine the existence, laterality and magnitude of a spatial bias in people of all ages with ADHD or suspected ADHD, and to explore the factors of moderation that could explain the heterogeneity of spatial bias in ADHD. A total of 11 studies were included, totalling 331 participants, based on the criterion that spatial bias was tested with the commonly used line bisection, landmark, or greyscales tasks. An increased ADHD diagnosis in children compared to adults, or increased recognition of symptoms in children with ADHD, has led to a literature that characterises predominantly childhood ADHD. Thus, the mean age of participants in this meta-analysis was 13.2 years. Due to specificities of the sample, three separate meta-analyses were performed: one with studies using the line bisection, landmark, or greyscales task (n = 11), one with studies using the predominant line bisection task (n = 8), and one revised version of the line bisection task analysis following the valid removal of a study outlier (n = 7). The latter analysis revealed a rightward lateralised spatial bias that is significantly different to zero in people with ADHD. Sex, age, and task modality were analysed as moderating variables, but had no effects. ADHD subtype could not be analysed as moderator variable due to limited data, but   3 is discussed along with other relevant variables e.g., task type, handedness. Overall, these results reveal a rightward spatial bias in people with ADHD. However, the results of this meta-analysis need to be interpreted with caution in light of its many limitations. More studies are needed to characterise spatial bias in ADHD, and properly assess the impact of moderating variables.
