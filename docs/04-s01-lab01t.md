**Abstract:** **Objectives: **The Covid-19 pandemic has provoked poor mental health in the general population due to restrictions being implemented, as well as fear of catching the virus. Body focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs), such as skin-picking and hairpulling, are comorbid with poor mental health. Students are a high-risk category for developing mental health disorders. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate poor mental health and BFRBs in students during the Covid-19 pandemic, in a non-clinical sample.<br> 
**Design: **A correlational design was used for this study.<br> 
**Methods: **Two hundred and six participants completed the Covid-19 Stress Scale (CSS; adapted from the Swine Flu Inventory), Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales - 21 Items (DASS-21), Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HPS) and the Skin-Picking Scale - Revised (SPS-R).<br>
**Results: **BFRBs were particularly prevalent in the student sample, with 57.8% reporting skin-picking behaviours and 32.5% reporting hairpulling behaviours. Participants reported high scores on the DASS-21 and the CSS. Skin-picking was positively correlated with DASS-21 and CSS scores. However, there was no relationship found between hairpulling scores and DASS-21 and CSS scores. <br> 
**Conclusions: **Skin-picking and hairpulling behaviours were prevalent in the non-clinical student sample. However, hairpulling was not correlated with mental health and Covid-19 stress. This may be due to the fact that skin-picking was more prevalent in this sample. We hope that this study will stimulate further investigation into these areas.

**Abstract:** Synaesthesia is a condition where people experience unusual sensory or cognitive sensations in response to apparently unrelated stimuli. The present study aimed to examine whether Virtual Reality (VR) technology can be used to recreate the synaesthetic experience. There is a lack of research in this area, with most studies focussing primarily on synaesthetic colours. This study aimed to build on previous research by using both a traditional colour-picker and VR to capture a more nuanced picture of synaesthesia. A multiple case study design was used to examine a small number of participants' experiences in detail. Data gathering took place via Zoom. During the initial data-gathering session, participants used a colour-picker to provide grapheme-colour associations. After this session, some of the participants' synaesthetic experiences were recreated in VR. Results indicated that VR is capable of capturing certain elements of synaesthesia that other methods have been unable to, such as texture and small degrees of movement. Limitations and future directions, including moving to a multi-user VR set-up, are discussed.

**Abstract:** Previous studies have revealed that surrogate mothers experience exclusion and stigma. Empirical research has evidenced a relationship between individual differences in pathogen disgust and stigma towards individuals without potential cues of infection (e.g., people with mental health conditions, immigrants, homosexuals), which supports the notion that overgeneralised disease avoidance may partly explain stigma (Oaten et al., 2011). Thus, we tested the relationship between the pathogen (main predictor), sexual and moral disgust (exploratory predictors) subscales of the Three Domain Disgust Scale (Tybur et al., 2009) and stigma, as measured by the Social Distance Scale (Link et al., 1987), towards four types of surrogate mothers: genetic, gestational, altruistic and commercial, in a sample of 229 participants. Contrary to our hypothesis, multiple regression analyses revealed that pathogen disgust did not significantly predict stigma towards genetic, altruistic and commercial surrogate mothers; pathogen disgust only significantly predicted stigma towards gestational surrogate mothers. However, other patterns were found. Sexual disgust significantly predicted stigma towards genetic and gestational surrogate mothers. Moral disgust was negatively related to stigma towards altruistic surrogate mothers. These results suggest that stigma towards surrogate mothers may be explained by the implication of different functional domains of disgust.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Disgust is often characterised as an evolutionary pathogen avoidance mechanism. It has previously been hypothesised that human pathogen avoidance mechanisms, measured by individual differences in pathogen disgust sensitivity, may overgeneralise to produce false alarms in the form of stigma, even when no pathogen threat is present. Past studies have suggested that pathogen disgust sensitivity predicts stigmatisation towards several groups, including those with certain mental illnesses. The present study sought to expand the range of mental disorders for which the relationship is studied for by examining 3 previously unstudied mental disorders (Bipolar, OCD and BPD) and compare these to one previously studied one (schizophrenia). An additional aim of the present study was to examine the potential moderating effect of pathogen cue priming on the strength of this relationship. Regression analyses (N = 96) indicated significant relationships for sexual disgust sensitivity and stigmatisation towards all disorders, as well as pathogen disgust sensitivity and stigmatisation towards BPD and schizophrenia. No moderating effect of pathogen cue priming was detected for any mental disorder. Pathogen and sexual disgust sensitivity are interpreted as disease-avoidance and mate choice-related heuristic evaluations contributing to stigmatisation of those with mental disorders. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research and stigma reduction interventions are discussed.

**Abstract:** This secondary analysis aimed to verify and expand upon the emotion overgeneralisation theory. We explored whether semantic similarity in positive (happy, delighted, joy) and negative emotions (anger, fury, rage) is reflected in facial expressions and perceived social traits (trustworthiness, dominance); further, whether patterns of facial movements play a role in facially conveying these semantically related emotions and eliciting perceptions of associated social traits. Our correlation and clustering findings suggest moderate overgeneralisation effects for all semantically related emotions, apart from anger. Clustering did reveal differences in similarity for related emotions, limiting the extent of a functional basis driving perceptions of semantically related emotions and associated traits. We determined distinct Action Units (AUs) which were important for perceptions of happiness and trustworthiness - Dimpler and Lip Corner Puller. Various Upper Lip Raisers and the Nose Wrinkler were important for perceptions of dominance, but less for negative emotions. Implications and limitations are discussed.

**Abstract:** Individuals that present signs of illness or contagion are often avoided to protect oneself from harmful infection. Those with noncontagious conditions (e.g., facial lesions or physical disabilities) are consequently stigmatised due to the overinclusive nature of this disease-avoidance mechanism. Recent findings suggest that pathogen disgust predicts the stigmatisation of individuals with mental health conditions, however research in this field is limited. This study systematically investigates the theory that an overgeneralisation of pathogen disgust, as a subscale of the Three-Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS), will similarly contribute to the stigmatisation of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. A sample of 125 participants (92 female, 30 male, 3 non-binary) completed the TDDS to index pathogen, sexual and moral disgust, and the AQ-27 to indicate the level of stigma towards four neurodevelopmental disorders; autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette's syndrome (TS) and cerebral palsy (CP). Results from a mixed effects analysis revealed that pathogen disgust predicted the stigmatisation of the four neurodevelopmental disorders. Conversely, scores from the moral disgust subscale showed a negative effect and the sexual disgust subscale did not have any relation to the stigmatisation of the disorders. Separate analysis of the disorders exemplified that pathogen disgust had a significant positive effect on the stigmatisation of ASD, TS and CP, but not ADHD. The main findings are broadly consistent with previous research and suggest an overgeneralised disease-avoidance mechanism may partly account for the stigmatisation of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.

**Abstract:** Emotion differentiation, known as the ability to make fine-grained distinctions between like-valenced states, has been repeatedly linked to improved well-being, enhanced emotion regulation competencies and reduced distress (Barrett et al., 2001; Kashdan et al., 2015; Starr et al., 2019). Previous assessments of this emotional skill disregarded the fact that this construct is likely to vary considerably across different life situations. To overcome this limitation, we used the Situated Assessment Method (SAM^2^) to develop three situated measures of emotion differentiation anchored in various facets of affective functioning. 87 subjects participated in an online survey and rated 17 stressful, non-stressful and eustressful Covid-19 life situations on eleven features relevant to emotional experience (e.g., emotion intensity, valence). Participants also completed standard, decontextualized self-report tools measuring alexithymia, emotion differentiation, emotion regulation, perceived stress and personality variables. Intraclass correlation coefficients revealed that participants differed substantially in their emotional ratings across the Covid-19 life situations.  Furthermore, the individual SAM^2^ measures of emotion differentiation correlated significantly, yet negatively with the SAM^2^ score of emotion regulation, unsituated perceived stress and neuroticism. An exploratory multiple linear regression found that perceived stress significantly predicted the overall SAM^2^ measure of emotion differentiation. These unexpected findings challenge the existing scholarly assumptions about emotion granularity, while providing evidence for the importance of real-life contexts in the assessment of multifaceted psychological constructs.

**Abstract:** It is currently unclear whether mental imagery is a necessary component of cross-modal feedback to early sensory cortices. Furthermore, the specific neural mechanisms which would subserve such a process are not entirely understood. To find answers to these questions, we gathered data collected in two previous studies which employed a cross-modal imagery paradigm in normally sighted and aphantasic populations. Using Granger Causality Mapping, we undertook an exploratory investigation into whether salient differences could be observed in the neural responses of these populations to this paradigm. Results generally did not show unambiguous task-relevant differences. However, activity was commonly seen to emerge in the default mode network in both populations, and cross-comparison revealed exclusive activity in the parahippocampal gyrus in normally sighted participants. With reference to literature, we tentatively suggest that this may represent a difference in functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the cortical nodes of the default mode network in aphantasic and normally sighted participants. This could theoretically account for results seen in previous studies investigating the relevance of imagery to cross-modal feedback to early sensory cortices. Implications and future directions are discussed.

**Title:** 

**Abstract:** Emotions are complex cognitive and physiological states that are tightly intertwined with subjective wellbeing and mental health. It is therefore key to regulate negative emotions adaptively, which is linked to emotion expression, and to avoid maladaptive strategies like suppression. Emotional competences are learnt throughout childhood and can be trained. However, current norms of gender roles in negative emotion expression may contribute to the suppression of internalising emotions in males, and of externalising emotions in females, thereby contributing to differential mental unhealth across genders. The media may reinforce the harmful gendered norms of negative emotion expression, as it tends to depict genders stereotypically. This study aims to determine whether the expression of negative emotions in current children's cartoons is depicted as gendered or as neutral. The frequency of 5 pre-selected categories of negative emotions was analysed in the content of 10 episodes of the cartoon series called 'Le Monde Incroyable de Gumball'. In a total of 77 minutes of viewing, 223 negative emotions were identified. The most frequent emotions were anger (39.9%) and fear (29.6%), followed by 'other' unspecified negative emotions (17.5%), sadness (8.1%), and finally disgust (4.9%). Age of the characters was controlled. Findings revealed a relationship between gender and anger expression across ages, with males expressing less anger than females, surprisingly. Gender did not predict the expression of any of the remaining four categories of negative emotions. Exploratory analysis revealed a relationship between age and 'other' unspecified negative emotions, with children expressing more of it than adults. Results are explained in light of the contemporary feminist movement, although more research is needed to confirm the observed results.
