**Dear Class of 2021, **

Hi everyone! Heather very kindly asked me to say a few words and I have to say this is quite a scary task because there are far too many graduation platitudes to fall into. We have all had such diverse experiences that it is impossible to find a way to cover all the struggles, the challenges, the successes, failures, losses and joys each person in this class has experienced.  

So, I brainstormed to figure out which moments were most important to me in this journey to today in the hope that maybe some of you find yourself in it. I have come to the conclusion that apart from labs, lectures, group work, clubs, societies, nights out and in, library sessions or at home studying and procrastinating, what I have always loved so much to share with many of you was the paths in-between and I want to dedicate a moment to them today. Yes, we have learned and grown so much and I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you about that today, seeing how you have proof of it in the form of your graduation. So let me explain what I mean by the paths in between. Flashback to first year: While I found those first semester lectures absolutely terrifying to walk into with that big hall where it was hard to figure out where those soon to be friends were sat so you had to walk along the front and feel like everyone was watching with every sound amplified in the cold dome of Bute hall, it was the way out that I first felt like I belonged here with those people around me. I genuinely don’t remember what was said in any of those moments but there was no pressure on them and it was a great moment to float around and have short chats, then leave and maybe come back for more some other time, that was a time for smiles and maybe a hello. Those first uncertain conversation soon became a regular occurrence throughout our time here. Walking down the Boyd Orr stairs, realising you have the same way home or to the library with someone you hadn’t really talked to before. Small talk while waiting for the class before to leave the lecture hall. Those are precious and defining moments for me to feel at home with the people and the course around. Whilst COVID took away many of those informal moments, I quickly realised that a face I only knew in passing was suddenly there for long conversations when running into each other on some street. And I genuinely loved meeting people in breakout rooms so much. Partly because of being deprived of social interaction, partly because those moments were like standing outside a lecture hall just longer and better because I didn’t just meet the people who kind of sat around me during the lecture. And I have to say, random people in breakout rooms are really cool and full of surprises and shared experiences. So, why these moments? They are so important to me because of the kindness that was exchanged in the smallest of gestures, the unreserved interest that was shown for the people around, and the openness to be present with each other. Yes, obviously we’re also masters of R, pretty impressive critical thinkers, and surely some of the smartest psychology graduates in the country – I’m only half joking, I keep being impressed by everyone around me. But this class is also very kind and takes time for each other and supports and laughs and grows together for our benefit and for those who come after us.  

To wrap this up, I’d like to say thank you to everyone who was a part of this journey, both the staff at the School of Psychology and all those students in this course, this was a safe and exciting place to learn with challenges and of course struggles but also with incredible support and care. There are many steps on this journey that I don’t know about so celebrate those, I congratulate you on them and I conclude in saying well done, you’re the best. 

**Leonie**
